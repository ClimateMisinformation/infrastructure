As adherents of the pro-life movement, we reject that portrayal as disingenuous and dangerous to our efforts to protect the lives of unborn children.

The term “pro-life” originated historically in the struggle to end abortion on demand and continues to be used in public discourse overwhelmingly in that sense. To ignore that is at best sloppy communication and at worst intentional deception. “Life” in “pro-life” denotes not quality of life but life itself. The whole term denotes opposition to a procedure that intentionally results in dead babies.

In stark contrast, most environmental policies promoted as pro-life address problems that pose little threat to human life itself, and no intent to kill.

In 2011, touting exaggerated numbers and harms, the Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN) claimed, “being pro-life means protecting the unborn from mercury pollution.” But such pollution does not kill. Rather, at worst it causes reduction in neurological development so slight as to be nearly undetectable. EEN made similar claims in 2012 and 2014, and in February 2016 it launched a “Pro-Life Clean Energy Campaign,” calling for 100% of America’s electricity to come from “renewable” sources. Regardless of the wisdom or folly of that demand, calling it pro-life is deceptive.

But the ethical differences between abortion and pollution are glaring:

The intent differs. In abortion, the intent is to kill a baby. In energy production, the intent is to provide the energy people need to sustain life and health, and the pollution that is a byproduct of energy production is an unintended risk (see Deuteronomy 19:4–12). The factual outcomes differ. In abortion, the outcome of every “successful abortion” is a dead baby. In energy production, the outcome of the energy produced is enhanced human health and life, while the outcome of the pollution byproduct is (compared with the immediate death of babies in abortion) a slight reduction in health—certainly not enough to outweigh the intended outcome.

In its past campaign, EEN thanked politicians with 100% pro-abortion voting records (even some who support partial-birth abortion) for being “sensitive to pro-life concerns” because they supported restrictions on mercury emissions, while rebuking politicians with 100% pro-life voting records because they didn’t.

At the time, over 30 pro-life leaders joined in signing an earlier version of this declaration, pointing out that EEN’s campaign

obscures the meaning of “pro-life,”

misidentifies some pro-abortion candidates as pro-life,

divides the pro-life movement, and

makes it more difficult to elect truly pro-life candidates to office.

EEN’s new “Pro-Life Clean Energy Campaign” will have the same results, and like the earlier campaign it also risks siphoning off activists from the real pro-life movement into a different movement one major aim of which is population control achieved in part by government-run family planning programs that include abortion—sometimes even forced abortion.

This doesn’t mean we should ignore environmental risks. It does mean combating them should not be portrayed as pro-life. Genuinely pro-life people will usually desire to reduce other risks as well—guided by cost/benefit analysis. But to call those issues “pro-life” is to obscure the meaning of the term.

Instead of disguising their desired policies as pro-life, environmental advocates need to make the case for them honestly and above board, by credible analysis of risks and benefits. They should cease claiming the pro-life banner. That is at best badly misinformed, at worst dishonest.

In light of these considerations:

We call on all environmentalists, evangelical or otherwise, to cease portraying their causes as pro-life and join us in working diligently to reduce and end abortion on demand in the United States, which has killed over 54 million babies since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision.

Consistent with the findings of A Call to Truth, Prudence, and Protection of the Poor 2014: The Case against Harmful Climate Policies Gets Stronger, we believe:

As the product of infinitely wise design, omnipotent creation, and faithful sustaining (Genesis 1:1–31; 8:21–22), Earth is robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting. Although Earth and its subsystems, including the climate system, are susceptible to some damage by ignorant or malicious human action, God’s wise design and faithful sustaining make these natural systems more likely—as confirmed by widespread scientific observation—to respond in ways that suppress and correct that damage than magnify it catastrophically. Earth’s temperature naturally warms and cools cyclically throughout time, and warmer periods are typically more conducive to human thriving than colder periods. While human addition of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), to the atmosphere may slightly raise atmospheric temperatures, observational studies indicate that the climate system responds more in ways that suppress than in ways that amplify CO 2 ’s effect on temperature, implying a relatively small and benign rather than large and dangerous warming effect. Empirical studies indicate that natural cycles outweigh human influences in producing the cycles of global warming and cooling, not only in the distant past but also recently. Computer climate models, over 95% of which point toward greater warming than has been observed during the period of rapid CO 2 increase, do not justify belief that human influences have come to outweigh natural influences, or fears that human-caused warming will be large and dangerous. Rising atmospheric CO 2 benefits all life on Earth by improving plant growth and crop yields, making food more abundant and affordable, helping the poor most of all. Abundant, affordable, reliable energy, most of it now and in the foreseeable future provided by burning fossil fuels, which are the primary source of CO 2 emissions, is indispensable to lifting and keeping people out of poverty. Mandatory reductions in CO 2 emissions, pursued to prevent dangerous global warming, would have little or no discernible impact on global temperatures, but would greatly increase the price of energy and therefore of everything else. Such policies would put more people at greater risk than the warming they are intended to prevent, because they would slow, stop, or even reverse the economic growth that enables people to adapt to all climates. They would also harm the poor more than the wealthy, and would harm them more than the small amount of warming they might prevent. In developed countries, the poor spend a higher percentage of their income on energy than others, so rising energy prices, driven by mandated shifts from abundant, affordable, reliable fossil fuels to diffuse, expensive, intermittent “Green” energy, will in effect be regressive taxes—taxing the poor at higher rates than the rich. In developing countries, billions of the poor desperately need to replace dirty, inefficient cooking and heating fuels, pollution from which causes hundreds of millions of illnesses and about 4 million premature deaths every year, mostly among women and young children. To demand that they forgo the use of inexpensive fossil fuels and depend on expensive wind, solar, and other “Green” fuels to meet that need is to condemn them to more generations of poverty and the high rates of disease and premature death that accompany it.

A Call to Action

In light of these facts,

We call on Christians to practice creation stewardship out of love for God and love for our neighbors—especially the poor. We call on Christian leaders to study the issues and embrace sound scientific, economic, and ethical thinking on creation stewardship, particularly climate change. We call on political leaders to abandon fruitless and harmful policies to control global temperature and instead adopt policies that simultaneously reflect responsible environmental stewardship, make energy and all its benefits more affordable, and so free the poor to rise out of poverty.

Protect the Poor: Ten Reasons to Oppose Harmful Climate Change Policies

Epigram

The greatest threat to the alleviation of the structural poverty of the Third World is the continuing campaign by western governments, egged on by some climate scientists and green activists, to curb greenhouse emissions, primarily the CO 2 from burning fossil fuels. …

[I]t is mankind’s use of the mineral energy stored in nature’s gift of fossil fuels … accompanying the slowly rolling Industrial Revolution, [that] allowed the ascent from structural poverty which had scarred humankind for millennia.

To put a limit on the use of fossil fuels without adequate economically viable alternatives is to condemn the Third World to perpetual structural poverty.

Realities and Myths about Global Poverty

Introduction:

Why Climate Policy Matters to Evangelical Christians

E. Calvin Beisner

Founder and National Spokesman, Cornwall Alliance

On June 2, 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a new rule requiring a 30% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from existing power plants by 2030. Compliance is estimated to cost about $50 billion per year, the loss of about $1,200 per year in income for the average family of four, and the loss of about 600,000 jobs. Is that a good idea, or a bad one?

Assuming that CO 2 warms the atmosphere as much as EPA (depending on the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]) claims, the “benefits” of compliance include, even according to EPA itself, a hypothetically calculable but observationally indiscernible 0.02˚C reduction in global average temperature by the end of this century, which would have no discernible impact on human or other life on the planet. If CO 2 ’s warming effect is actually much less, then the indiscernibly small global temperature reduction will be even smaller. …

The authors of the two chapters of this paper are not only fully credentialed, veteran university researchers and professors in the academic disciplines relevant to their contributions but also evangelical Christians committed to glorifying God through responsible stewardship of the earth.

In Chapter 1, climatologist Dr. David R. Legates rehearses the scientific evidence that CO 2 ’s impact on global temperature is much smaller than IPCC and other alarmists claim, and that there is no persuasive scientific evidence that human emissions of CO 2 have caused, or in the foreseeable future will cause, dangerous global warming.

In Chapter 2, environmental economist Dr. G. Cornelis “Kees” van Kooten rehearses the economic evidence that policies to fight global warming by reducing CO 2 emissions by switching from fossil fuels to wind, solar, and other “renewable” sources will do far more harm than good to the world’s poor.

For evangelical Christians, who take seriously the Bible’s emphasis on protecting the vulnerable from harm (Psalm 12:5; 35:10; 41:1; 72:4, 12; Proverbs 31:9; Galatians 2:10), these two chapters and the information above provide compelling evidence that to protect the poor, we must oppose such policies and instead support policies that simultaneously reflect responsible environmental stewardship (Genesis 1:28; 2:15), make energy and all its benefits more affordable, and so free the poor to rise out of poverty. To take this position is not to suggest that we may abuse the earth or any of its ecological systems. It is to conclude, instead, that what some people consider an abuse of the earth (obtaining energy from fossil fuels and so adding CO 2 to the atmosphere) is not an abuse of the earth but is instead a vitally important way of improving human wellbeing.

The Cornwall Alliance offers this paper in support of a new declaration, “Protect the Poor: Ten Reasons to Oppose Harmful Climate Change Policies,” and encourages our evangelical Christian brothers and sisters to join us in endorsing it and to share it with others, including political representatives at national, state, and local levels. …

Chapter 1

Greenhouse Gases and Warming of the Earth

David R. Legates

Professor of Climatology

University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA

Few controversies have received greater attention around the world in the last twenty years than that over global warming. Some think it threatens the very survival of the human race, others that it is little or nothing to worry about—and there are many intermediate positions. What is a well-informed, faithful Christian perspective?

At the outset, let us define what the debate is not about. The debate is not about whether our climate is changing; indeed, it always has changed on timescales ranging from decades to millennia. It is not about whether humans can influence the Earth’s climate; they certainly do. It is not about whether global air temperatures have risen over the past 160 years; they have. The real questions that define this debate are: (1) To what extent are humans responsible for the climate change we see? (2) What are the future consequences of climate change, from both natural and anthropogenic sources? (3) How should we respond? This paper focuses on the first question and provides implications for the second and third. …

Summary

As Christians, we are exhorted both to “Test all things, hold fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21) and to be good stewards of our environment (Genesis 1:26–28; 2:15)—especially when millions on the planet are without clean water, adequate sanitation, and affordable energy. We certainly do not want to squander precious resources or harm our environment, but neither do we want to waste our time and efforts to “solve” non-problems. An examination of the science shows that the sensitivity of our planet to greenhouse gases is not as large as the climate models indicate, and, indeed, higher levels of carbon dioxide are beneficial to life on Earth, since plants grow better in response to more carbon dioxide. Climate change is both natural and human-induced and has always occurred, since climate is not simply “average weather”; it is dynamic and variable. The evidence shows that much of the climate variability we see is attributable to natural climate fluctuations with a small contribution of rising global air temperatures due to changes in anthropogenic carbon dioxide concentrations.

Proponents of efforts to mitigate climate change often appeal to the “Precautionary Principle,” which was set forth in Principle #15 of the Rio Declaration in 1992: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities … where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.” In light of that, we are urged to take draconian action to avert climate change even if scientific proof that a problem exists is lacking or the efficacy of recommended remedies is unproven. But we must also remember the Corollary to the Precautionary Principle: “Action to abate climate change, either natural or human-induced, shall not be taken until it can be demonstrated that the proposed response will (1) effect a positive remedy to the issue at hand and (2) not have adverse impacts that will create new problems or exacerbate existing ones.” We believe attempts to reduce climate change will increase the cost of providing electricity to the over 1 billion people in the world who now lack it, thus prolonging their dependence on wood, dried dung, and other biomass as principal heating and cooking fuels, which in turn causes hundreds of millions of upper respiratory diseases and over 4 million premature deaths annually in the developing world, primarily among women and young children (World Health Organization, 2014). We cannot forget the world’s poorest citizens, who will be the hardest hit by the severe energy restrictions imposed by climate “stabilization” efforts.

Climate Policy, Economics, and the Poor

G. Cornelis van Kooten, Ph.D.

Professor of Economics and Canada Research Chair in Environmental Studies

University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada

Conclusion

The Economist (September 25, 2010, p. 117) reported that, in 2009, 1.44 billion people lacked access to electricity, and all but three million of those lived outside the rich, developed countries. Worse yet, some 2.7 billion still cook their food on inefficient stoves that use dung, crop residues, and fuel wood. It is estimated that perhaps 2 million people die prematurely each year because of health problems associated with biomass-burning stoves (p. 72). Collection of biomass for burning occupies much time (mainly of women and children) that could otherwise be used to produce wealth, robs cropland of important nutrients that can only partly be replaced by artificial fertilizers from offsite, and causes deforestation.

One-quarter to one-third of the world’s population—1.75 billion to 2.33 billion people—need access to electricity and high-density energy such as currently can be provided only from fossil and nuclear fuels, so that they can live decent lives and have some hope that their children will lead a better life than they. Again, it would be immoral to deny the poor the ability to develop by curtailing their access to abundant, affordable, reliable energy, all in pursuit of an environmental objective that only interests one billion rich people.

Human-induced climate change, also known as anthropogenic global warming (AGW), is real. Crucial questions facing the public and policymakers are its magnitude, its benefits and harms relative to the benefits and harms of the activities that drive it, and the benefits and harms of proposed responses to it.

As the American people and their political representatives formulate policy regarding AGW, they should consider the following:

Human Exceptionalism and Humanity’s Role in the Earth

Severe poverty, widespread hunger, rampant disease, and short life spans were the ordinary condition of humankind until the last two-and-a-half centuries. These tragedies are normal when human beings act and are treated as if they were mere animals, which need to submit to nature. The Judeo-Christian heritage (Genesis 1:28; 2:15), in agreement with common sense, teaches instead that human beings are exceptional, able to rule over nature, freeing ourselves from poverty and hunger to live long and healthy lives. Our rule over nature should express not the abusive rule of a tyrant but the loving and generous rule of God the Creator (Genesis 2:15). It should thus express itself by enhancing the fruitfulness, beauty, and safety of the earth (Genesis 1:1–31; 2:4–14), to the glory of God and the benefit of our neighbors (Matthew 22:36–38).

How Societies Overcome Poverty

Our Judeo-Christian moral tradition puts a high priority on protecting and helping the poor (Psalm 41:1; Galatians 2:10). It also teaches, along with economic history, that what delivers people from absolute material poverty is a combination of moral, social, political, scientific, and technological institutions. These include science and technology grounded on a view of the physical world as an ordered cosmos that rational creatures can understand and harness for human betterment; private property rights, entrepreneurship, and widespread trade, protected by the rule of law enforced by limited and responsive governments; and abundant, affordable, reliable energy generated from high-density, portable, constantly accessible sources. By replacing animal and human muscle and low-density energy sources like wood, dung, and other biofuels, and low-density, intermittent wind and solar, fossil and nuclear fuels have freed people from the basic tasks of survival to devote time and bodily energy to other occupations.

Empirical Evidence Suggests that Fossil Fuel Use Will Not Cause Catastrophic Warming

Many fear that carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use endanger humanity and the environment because they lead to historically unprecedented, dangerous global warming. This has led many well-meaning people to call for reduced carbon dioxide emissions and hence reduced use of fossil fuels.

Computer climate models of the warming effect of enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide are the basis for that fear. However, to validly inform policymaking, computer climate models must be validated by real-world observation, and they have not been. Over time, observed global average temperature (GAT) diverges increasingly from modeled GAT.

On average, models simulate more than twice the warming observed over the period during which anthropogenic warming is supposed to have been the greatest (about the last 35 years). None simulate the complete absence of observed warming over approximately the last 20 years at Earth’s surface and 17 to 27 years in the lower troposphere (where we live).[1] Over 95 percent simulate more warming than observed. These data confirm the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) observation that we are currently experiencing an absence of global warming long enough to be nearly impossible to reconcile with the models.

All of this makes it increasingly clear that the models greatly exaggerate the warming effect of carbon dioxide. The models’ errors are not random—as often above as below observed temperatures, and by similar magnitudes—but consistently above observed temperatures, making it apparent that the models are biased. The large and growing divergence between model simulations and observed GAT severely reduces the models’ credibility both for predicting future GAT and for informing policy.

The Judeo-Christian worldview provided the basis for scientific method by teaching that a rational God designed an ordered universe to be understood and controlled by rational persons made in His image (Genesis 1:26), which is why science as a systematic activity arose in medieval Europe. One of Christ’s apostles, Paul, even asserted the essence of science when he wrote, “Test all things, hold fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21). In that spirit, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman explained “the key to science” this way:

In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right. Then we compare the result of the computation to nature, with experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation, to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is. It does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is—if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. That is all there is to it.[2]

We would add to Feynman’s statement that it also makes no difference how many people agree with your guess. The scientific method never appeals to consensus. It demands that theories be tested by empirical observation. By that test, the models are wrong. They therefore provide no rational basis to forecast dangerous human-induced global warming and no rational basis for efforts to reduce warming, whether by restricting the use of fossil fuels or by any other means.

For the Foreseeable Future, Wind and Solar Energy Cannot Effectively Replace Fossil Fuel and Nuclear Energy

Fossil fuels, because of their lower costs and higher efficiency, account for over 85 percent of total global energy use, and nuclear energy for about 6 percent. Wind and solar energy, because of their higher costs and lower efficiency, account for only a few percent. Mandated substitution of low-density, intermittent energy sources like wind and solar for high-density, constant sources like fossil fuels, before the former technologies become economically competitive, would be catastrophic to the world’s poor. It would simultaneously raise the cost and reduce the reliability and availability of energy, especially electricity. This, in turn, would raise the cost of all other goods and services—especially food—since all require energy to produce and transport. It would destroy scores to hundreds of thousands of jobs in America and, by slowing economic growth, prevent the creation of millions more here and abroad, especially in the developing world. It would slow the rise of the poor out of poverty and threaten to return millions to it. And it would make electricity grids unstable, leading to more frequent and widespread, costly and often fatal, brownouts and blackouts—events mercifully rare in wealthy countries but all too familiar to billions of people living in countries without comprehensive, stable electric grids supplied by stable fossil or nuclear fuels.

The Poor Would Suffer Most from Attempts to Restrict Affordable Energy Use

The poor, whether in America or elsewhere, will suffer most from such policies. The world’s poorest—the 1.3 billion in developing countries who depend on wood and dried dung as primary cooking and heating fuels, smoke from which kills 4 million and temporarily debilitates hundreds of millions every year—will be condemned to more generations of poverty and its deadly consequences. Instead, they desperately need to replace such primitive and dirty fuels with electricity, the most affordable sources of which are fossil fuels.

The poor in the developed world, too, need more, and cheaper, electricity and other energy from fossil fuels. On average, they spend two or more times as much of their incomes on energy as the middle class. When governments mandate substitution of wind and solar for fossil fuels, the affected poor lose access to decent food, housing, education, health care, and more as their energy costs rise. Some freeze to death, as tens of thousands did in the United Kingdom in several recent winters due to that nation’s rush to substitute wind and solar for coal to generate electricity, because they are unable to pay their electricity bills and still buy enough food.

Affordable Energy Can Help Millions of the World’s Poor Emerge from Poverty

The same computer climate models that exaggerate the warming effect of atmospheric carbon dioxide nonetheless rightly simulate that greater economic development driven by growing use of fossil fuels will add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Consequently, the IPCC finds that the warmest scenarios for the future are also the richest, especially for those societies that are now the poorest.

The risks of poverty and misguided energy policies that would prolong it far outweigh the risks of climate change. Adequate wealth enables people to thrive in a wide array of climates, hot or cold, wet or dry. Poverty undermines human health and life even in the best of climates. It follows that because reducing fossil fuel use means reducing economic development, it also means condemning poor societies to remain poor, and requiring poor people of today to sacrifice for richer people of the future—a clear injustice.

Rising Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Enhances Plant Growth

While adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere causes far less warming than previously feared, it has a positive effect on plant life. Scientifically understood, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant but a gas harmless at twenty times its current atmospheric concentration and vital to all life on the earth.

With more carbon dioxide in the air, plants grow better in warmer and cooler temperatures and wetter and drier soils, make better use of soil nutrients, and resist diseases and pests better, increasing their fruit production, expanding their range, and greening the earth. This makes more food available to all other creatures, especially—as agricultural yields rise, making food more affordable—the world’s poor. Substituting wind, solar, and other low-density energy sources for coal, oil, and natural gas therefore hurts the poor not only by raising energy (and all other) prices but also by reducing food production. It also hurts the rest of life on earth by depriving it of the fertilizing effect of heightened carbon dioxide.

By using fossil fuels to generate energy to lift billions of God’s precious children out of poverty, we liberate from the tomb of the earth the carbon dioxide on which plants and therefore all the rest of life depend. This beautifully reveals the Creator’s wisdom and care for all of His creation—people, animals, plants, and the earth itself.

Summary and Call to Action

Climate change is overwhelmingly natural and cyclical; human contribution to it is slight and not dangerous; attempts to reduce human contribution by reducing CO2 emissions would cause more harm than good; and expanded use of fossil fuels is necessary to provide the abundant, affordable, reliable energy indispensable to lifting and keeping societies out of poverty. Although CO2 emissions warm the earth slightly, they do not warm it dangerously, and the benefits of fossil fuel use, especially in enabling whole societies to rise, and remain, out of poverty, far outweigh whatever risks might accompany their small contribution to global warming.

In light of these considerations,

We call on the American people to speak out against policies aimed at curbing global warming and make their views known to opinion leaders at local, state, and national levels. We call on local, state, and federal policymakers to speak out against and refuse to endorse any global agreements that require such policies. We call on the news media both to resist demands by climate alarmists to conform their coverage of climate science and policy to any consensus that human activity is causing dangerous climate change and to refuse to characterize those who challenge any such consensus on scientific grounds as “deniers,” a pejorative term incompatible with rational, open, respectful discussion of scientific issues.

It is both unwise and unjust to adopt policies, whether at local, state, or federal levels, let alone a global agreement, requiring reduced use of fossil fuels for energy. Such policies would condemn hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings to ongoing poverty, and put hundreds of millions more at risk of returning to the poverty from which they rose, while achieving no significant climate benefit. We respectfully appeal to you to reject them.

https://cornwallalliance.org/landmark-documents/the-biblical-perspective-of-environmental-stewardship-subduing-and-ruling-the-earth-to-the-glory-of-god-and-the-benefit-of-our-neighbors/,The Biblical Perspective of Environmental Stewardship: Subduing and Ruling the Earth to the Glory of God and the Benefit of Our Neighbors,Cornwall Alliance,,,"1. We affirm that the Earth is the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof (Psalm 24:1).

We deny that the Earth or anything else is the result of impersonal, blind chance over time.

2. We affirm that the Bible—the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments—is the sole, absolute, inerrant epistemological basis for mankind for all knowledge of all things, seen and unseen, and that all claims of truth and moral duty that contradict it are false and harmful.

We deny that the physical universe and human observations of it justify truth claims contrary to those of the Bible, and that liberty, justice, and human dignity can be sustained while rejecting Biblical truth and law.

3. We affirm that the only true God—a spirit infinite, eternal, and immutable—revealed Himself in creation (which He made out of nothing and includes both physical and spiritual things), the Bible, and His one and only Son, Jesus Christ, and that though God reveals His wisdom and power in the creation, He is, always has been, and always will be absolutely distinct from and transcendent over creation, which He rules at all times and places.

We deny atheism (there is no God), pantheism (everything is God), panentheism (God is to the universe as the human soul is to the human body), animism (there are many gods, and they indwell and animate physical objects as human souls indwell and animate human bodies), and any other view that denies the Creator/creature distinction, because those who hold them exchange the truth about God for a lie and worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever (Romans 1:25).

4. We affirm that human dignity, freedom, and justice can be sustained only insofar as a society affirms the Creator/ creature distinction and embraces the truth of Scripture, and that those who deny it become futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts are darkened (Romans 1:21).

We deny that societies built on atheism, pantheism, panentheism, animism (also called spiritism), or any other rejection of the Creator/creature distinction can flourish intellectually, morally, aesthetically, and materially.

We affirm that the creation includes persons— conscious spirits capable of reason, moral judgment, and affection, and therefore morally accountable for their actions—and that some of these persons are bodiless (immaterial, e.g. angels and demons) and some embodied (combinations of spirit and body, e.g., humans).

We deny that the material cosmos—“nature” and its parts, the created world of time and space, matter and energy, planets and stars, energy and material elements—is personal, either in its whole or in its parts; hence we deny that forests and trees, mountains and rocks, oceans and lakes and streams, and animals are persons.

6. We affirm that God made man, male and female, in His own image (Genesis 1:26–27).

We deny that any other terrestrial life form bears the image of God or is of equal value or priority with human beings (Matthew 10:29–31).

7. We affirm that though the Earth is the LORD’s, He has also given it to men (Psalm 115:16) and mandated that they be fruitful, multiply, fill the Earth, subdue it, and have dominion over everything that lives in it (Genesis 1:28).

We deny that human dominion over the Earth is, in principle, sinful, and that the possibility of its abuse negates the righteousness of its proper use.

8. We affirm that the Earth and all its physical and biological systems are the effects of God’s omniscient design, omnipotent creation and faithful sustaining, and that when God completed His creative work it was “very good” (Genesis 1:31).

We deny that an infinitely wise Designer, infinitely powerful Creator, and perfectly faithful Sustainer of the Earth would have made it susceptible to catastrophic degradation from proportionally small causes, and consequently we deny that wise environmental stewardship readily embraces claims of catastrophe stemming from such causes.

9. We affirm that by God’s design Earth and its physical and biological systems are robust, resilient, and self-correcting.

We deny that they are fragile.

10. We affirm that godly human dominion over the Earth means men and women, created in the image of God, laboring freely and lovingly together to enhance Earth’s safety, fruitfulness, and beauty, to the glory of God and the benefit of our neighbors.

We deny that godly human dominion entails humans’ being servants rather than masters of the Earth.

11. We affirm that when God had created Adam, He placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and guard it (Genesis 2:15).

We deny that the Garden of Eden represents the whole Earth and that the instruction to “cultivate and guard” the Garden ought to be reinterpreted to mean either that man is to “serve and protect” the Garden or the Earth, or that man is to “worship and protect” the Garden or the Earth, or that man is to “worship and hear” God either directly or through the Earth or its parts.

12. We affirm that a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between God’s placing Adam in the Garden to cultivate and guard it (Genesis 2:15) and God’s commanding Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth and subdue and rule everything in it (Genesis 1:28) entails a growing population that spreads out from the Garden to till the whole Earth and transform it from wilderness to garden and ultimately to garden city (Revelation 21:2; 22:1–3).

We deny that Biblical Earth stewardship, or godly dominion, is limited to keeping Earth in the condition in which man finds it, i.e., we deny that, as many environmentalists put it, “Nature knows best” and its transformation by humans is in principle wrong or harmful.

13. We affirm that the Bible normally associates wilderness or wildness with divine judgment and curse (Exodus 23:29; Leviticus 26:22; Deuteronomy 7:22; 1 Samuel 17:46; Isaiah 5:2–4; 13:19–22; 34:1–17; Jeremiah 50:39; Leviticus 16:21–22).

We deny that wilderness is the best state of the Earth.

14. We affirm that God placed minerals, plants, and animals in and on the Earth for His pleasure, to reveal His glory and elicit man’s praise, and to serve human needs through godly use (Genesis 2:5–16; 4:22; Numbers 31:21–23; Job 38–41; Psalm 19:1–6; Psalm 104).

We deny that recognizing instrumental value in the Earth and its various physical and biological components dishonors God or is idolatrous.

15. We affirm that one way of exercising godly dominion is by transforming raw materials into resources and using them to meet human needs.

We deny that leaving everything in the Earth in its natural state is proper Biblical stewardship (Matthew 25:14–30).

16. We affirm that because of man’s fall into sin, sinful human hearts often fall prey to materialism, the covetous love of money, and the selfish accumulation of possessions (Luke 12:16–21; 1 Timothy 6:10; Colossians 3:5).

We deny that the temptation to materialist idolatry entails that the production of wealth, whether material from the Earth or immaterial from the human mind, is sinful in and of itself.

17. We affirm that man is accountable to God’s judgment in all he does with the Earth.

We deny that man’s accountability to God justifies abolishing private property (Exodus 20:15, 17), adopting collectivist economic institutions, or delegating to civil governments—whether local, national, or global—ownership or control of land, natural resources, or private property.

18. We affirm that man’s fall into sin (Genesis 3) entails the possibility and indeed the historical reality of human abuse of the Earth and of fellow humans.

We deny that man’s fall into sin completely destroys the possibility of godly dominion.

19. We affirm that in response to man’s sin God cursed the ground so that it would not, as before sin, yield easily even to godly dominion/cultivation, let alone to ungodly, abusive domination (Genesis 3:17–19), and indeed subjected the whole cosmos to decay and corruption until He restores it partially in history by obedience to the dominion mandate (Genesis 1:28), whether by the unregenerate through common grace (Matthew 7:11) or by the regenerate through special grace (Romans 8:18–24) , and fully in the New Heavens and New Earth of the eschaton (Revelation 21:1–3, 22–27; 22:1–5), all secured by the redeeming work of Christ (Colossians 1:14–20).

We deny, due to God’s faithfulness to His covenant, in which He proclaimed, after the Flood, that He would sustain the cycles on which terrestrial life depends for as long as the Earth endures (Genesis 8:22), that God’s curse on the Earth negates either the dominion mandate (Genesis 1:28) or the robustness and self-correcting resilience of the God-sustained Earth.

20. We affirm that human multiplication and filling of the Earth are intrinsically good (Genesis 1:28) and that, in principle, children, lots of them, are a blessing from God to their faithful parents and the rest of the Earth (Psalm 127; 128).

We deny that the Earth is overpopulated; that “overpopulation” is even a meaningful term, since it cannot be defined by demographic quantities such as population density, population growth rate, or age distribution; and that godly dominion over the Earth requires population control or “family planning” to limit fertility.

21. We affirm that when the Bible speaks of God’s judgment on human societies because they have “polluted the land,” the “pollution” in mind is consistently not chemical or biological but moral—the pollution of idolatry, adultery, murder, oppression of the weak, and other violations of the moral law of God expressed in the Ten Commandments (Psalm 106:38; Jeremiah 3:1–10; 16:18).

We deny that Biblical prophets’ concerns about the pollution of any land focus significantly on chemical emissions from agriculture or industry, although prudent study of the risks those pose to human and ecosystem health is a worthy task and can lead to proper efforts to balance risks and benefits.

22. We affirm that cost/benefit analysis (Luke 14:28) is a proper and critically important aspect of godly dominion over the Earth (Proverbs 14:4).

We deny that cost/benefit analysis is unprincipled pragmatism or indicates a lack of faith in God.

23. We affirm that, pursuant to sin and the curse, risk is inherent in every human activity (Hebrews 9:27) and therefore that it is lawful in principle to balance risk against risk.

We deny that the mere existence of risk in an activity makes it immoral in principle.

24. We affirm that proper environmental prioritization will address greater risks before lesser risks and take into account the opportunity costs of fighting various risks—i.e., that it will recognize that since resources spent to reduce one risk cannot be used to reduce another, it is wise to allocate resources where they will achieve the greatest risk reduction.

We deny that spending vast resources to reduce small risks, when those resources could be spent to reduce greater risks instead, is good environmental stewardship.

25. We affirm that environmental policies that address relatively minor risks while harming the poor—such as opposition to the use of abundant, affordable, reliable energy sources like fossil fuels in the name of fighting global warming; the suppression of the use of safe, affordable, and effective insecticides like DDT to reduce malaria in the name of protecting biodiversity; and the conversion of vast amounts of corn and other agricultural products into engine fuel in the name of ecological protection—constitute oppression of the world’s poor.

We deny that the policies named, and many others like them, are morally justified.

26. We affirm that, because a clean, safe, healthful, beautiful environment is a costly good, wealthy societies can better afford environmental protection and restoration than poor societies.

We deny that economic development is, per se, a threat to environmental quality.

27. We affirm that private ownership of land and other resources, because it harnesses God-given human incentives to overcome the “tragedy of the commons,” is the best institutional economic system for environmental protection.

We deny that collective economic systems are equally good at protecting or improving natural environments.

28. We affirm that local, constitutionally limited, responsive governments by the consent of the governed are better suited to environmental stewardship than central, unlimited governments without regard to the consent of the governed.

We deny that socialism, fascism, communism, and other forms of collectivist, expansionist government offer better solutions to environmental risks than limited, free, constitutional governments with market economies.

29. We affirm that truth-telling is a moral obligation and that sound environmental stewardship depends on it.

We deny that intentional exaggeration, as practiced by many environmental advocacy organizations, or minimization, as practiced by many industries, of environmental risks or of the effectiveness of various means of addressing them is righteous.

30. We affirm that godly dominion is a responsibility for everyone at all times.

We deny that the expectation of divine judgment, in whatever eschatological framework, negates the need for Biblical Earth stewardship.

The past millennium brought unprecedented improvements in human health, nutrition, and life expectancy, especially among those most blessed by political and economic liberty and advances in science and technology. At the dawn of a new millennium, the opportunity exists to build on these advances and to extend them to more of the earth’s people.

At the same time, many are concerned that liberty, science, and technology are more a threat to the environment than a blessing to humanity and nature. Out of shared reverence for God and His creation and love for our neighbors, we Jews, Catholics, and Protestants, speaking for ourselves and not officially on behalf of our respective communities, joined by others of good will, and committed to justice and compassion, unite in this declaration of our common concerns, beliefs, and aspirations.

Our Concerns

Human understanding and control of natural processes empower people not only to improve the human condition but also to do great harm to each other, to the earth, and to other creatures. As concerns about the environment have grown in recent decades, the moral necessity of ecological stewardship has become increasingly clear.

At the same time, however, certain misconceptions about nature and science, coupled with erroneous theological and anthropological positions, impede the advancement of a sound environmental ethic. In the midst of controversy over such matters, it is critically important to remember that while passion may energize environmental activism, it is reason—including sound theology and sound science—that must guide the decision-making process. We identify three areas of common misunderstanding:

Many people mistakenly view humans as principally consumers and polluters rather than producers and stewards. Consequently, they ignore our potential, as bearers of God’s image, to add to the earth’s abundance. The increasing realization of this potential has enabled people in societies blessed with an advanced economy not only to reduce pollution, while producing more of the goods and services responsible for the great improvements in the human condition, but also to alleviate the negative effects of much past pollution. A clean environment is a costly good; consequently, growing affluence, technological innovation, and the application of human and material capital are integral to environmental improvement. The tendency among some to oppose economic progress in the name of environmental stewardship is often sadly self-defeating. Many people believe that “nature knows best,” or that the earth—untouched by human hands—is the ideal. Such romanticism leads some to deify nature or oppose human dominion over creation. Our position, informed by revelation and confirmed by reason and experience, views human stewardship that unlocks the potential in creation for all the earth’s inhabitants as good. Humanity alone of all the created order is capable of developing other resources and can thus enrich creation, so it can properly be said that the human person is the most valuable resource on earth. Human life, therefore, must be cherished and allowed to flourish. The alternative—denying the possibility of beneficial human management of the earth— removes all rationale for environmental stewardship. While some environmental concerns are well founded and serious, others are without foundation or greatly exaggerated. Some well-founded concerns focus on human health problems in the developing world arising from inadequate sanitation, widespread use of primitive biomass fuels like wood and dung, and primitive agricultural, industrial, and commercial practices; distorted resource consumption patterns driven by perverse economic incentives; and improper disposal of nuclear and other hazardous wastes in nations lacking adequate regulatory and legal safeguards. Some unfounded or undue concerns include fears of destructive manmade global warming, overpopulation, and rampant species loss. The real and merely alleged problems differ in the following ways: The former are proven and well understood, while the latter tend to be speculative. The former are often localized, while the latter are said to be global and cataclysmic in scope. The former are of concern to people in developing nations especially, while the latter are of concern mainly to environmentalists in wealthy nations. The former are of high and firmly established risk to human life and health, while the latter are of very low and largely hypothetical risk. Solutions proposed to the former are cost effective and maintain proven benefit, while solutions to the latter are unjustifiably costly and of dubious benefit.

Public policies to combat exaggerated risks can dangerously delay or reverse the economic development necessary to improve not only human life but also human stewardship of the environment. The poor, who are most often citizens of developing nations, are often forced to suffer longer in poverty with its attendant high rates of malnutrition, disease, and mortality; as a consequence, they are often the most injured by such misguided, though well-intended, policies.

Our Beliefs

Our common Judeo-Christian heritage teaches that the following theological and anthropological principles are the foundation of environmental stewardship:

God, the Creator of all things, rules over all and deserves our worship and adoration. The earth, and with it all the cosmos, reveals its Creator’s wisdom and is sustained and governed by His power and lovingkindness. Men and women were created in the image of God, given a privileged place among creatures, and commanded to exercise stewardship over the earth. Human persons are moral agents for whom freedom is an essential condition of responsible action. Sound environmental stewardship must attend both to the demands of human well being and to a divine call for human beings to exercise caring dominion over the earth. It affirms that human well being and the integrity of creation are not only compatible but also dynamically interdependent realities. God’s Law—summarized in the Decalogue and the two Great Commandments (to love God and neighbor), which are written on the human heart, thus revealing His own righteous character to the human person— represents God’s design for shalom, or peace, and is the supreme rule of all conduct, for which personal or social prejudices must not be substituted. By disobeying God’s Law, humankind brought on itself moral and physical corruption as well as divine condemnation in the form of a curse on the earth. Since the fall into sin people have often ignored their Creator, harmed their neighbors, and defiled the good creation. God in His mercy has not abandoned sinful people or the created order but has acted throughout history to restore men and women to fellowship with Him and through their stewardship to enhance the beauty and fertility of the earth. Human beings are called to be fruitful, to bring forth good things from the earth, to join with God in making provision for our temporal well being, and to enhance the beauty and fruitfulness of the rest of the earth. Our call to fruitfulness, therefore, is not contrary to but mutually complementary with our call to steward God’s gifts. This call implies a serious commitment to fostering the intellectual, moral, and religious habits and practices needed for free economies and genuine care for the environment.

Our Aspirations

In light of these beliefs and concerns, we declare the following principled aspirations:"

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The world is in the grip of an idea: that burning fossil fuels to provide affordable, abundant energy is causing global warming that will be so dangerous that we must stop it by reducing our use of fossil fuels, no matter the cost.Is that idea true?

We believe not.

We believe that idea—we’ll call it “global warming alarmism”—fails the tests of theology, science, and economics. It rests on poor theology, with a worldview of the Earth and its climate system contrary to that taught in the Bible. It rests on poor science that confuses theory with observation, computer models with reality, and model results with evidence, all while ignoring the lessons of climate history. It rests on poor economics, failing to do reasonable cost/benefit analysis, ignoring or underestimating the costs of reducing fossil fuel use while exaggerating the benefits. And it bears fruit in unethical policy that would

destroy millions of jobs.

cost trillions of dollars in lost economic production.

slow, stop, or reverse economic growth.

reduce the standard of living for all but the elite few who are well positioned to benefit from laws that unfairly advantage them at the expense of most businesses and all consumers.

endanger liberty by putting vast new powers over private, social, and market life in the hands of national and international governments.

condemn the world’s poor to generations of continued misery characterized by rampant disease and premature death.

In return for all these sacrifices, what will the world get? At most a negligible, undetectable reduction in global average temperature a hundred years from now.

Our examination of theology, worldview, and ethics (Chapter One) finds that global warming alarmism wrongly views the Earth and its ecosystems as the fragile product of chance, not the robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting product of God’s wise design and powerful sustaining. It rests on and promotes a view of human beings as threats to Earth’s flourishing rather than the bearers of God’s image, crowned with glory and honor, and given a mandate to act as stewards over the Earth—filling, subduing, and ruling it for God’s glory and mankind’s benefit. It either wrongly assumes that the environment can flourish only if humanity forfeits economic advance and prosperity or ignores economic impacts altogether. And in its rush to impose draconian reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, it ignores the destructive impact of that policy on the world’s poor.

Our examination of the science of global warming (Chapter Two) finds that global warming alarmism wrongly claims that recent temperature changes have been greater and more rapid than those of the past and therefore must be manmade, not natural. It exaggerates the influence of manmade greenhouse gases on global temperature and ignores or underestimates the influence of natural cycles. It mistakenly takes the output of computer climate models as evidence when it is only predictions based on hypotheses that must be tested by observation. It falsely claims overwhelming scientific consensus in favor of the hypothesis of dangerous manmade warming (ignoring tens of thousands of scientists who disagree) and then falsely claims that such consensus proves the hypothesis and justifies policies to fight it. It seeks to intimidate or demonize scientific skeptics rather than welcoming their work as of the very essence of scientific inquiry: putting hypotheses to the test rather than blindly embracing them.

Our examination of the economics of global warming alarmism (Chapter Three) finds that it exaggerates the harms from global warming and ignores or underestimates the benefits not only from warming but also from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. It grossly underestimates the costs and overestimates the benefits of policies meant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It exaggerates the technical feasibility and underestimates the costs of alternative fuels to replace fossil fuels in providing the abundant, affordable energy necessary for wealth creation and poverty reduction. It ignores the urgent need to provide cleaner energy to the roughly two billion poor in the world whose use of wood and dung as primary cooking and heating fuels causes millions of premature deaths and hundreds of millions of debilitating respiratory diseases every year. It fails to recognize that the slowed economic development resulting from its own policies will cost many times more human lives than would the warming it is meant to avert.

In light of all these findings, we conclude that

human activity has negligible influence on global temperature,

the influence is not dangerous,

there is no need to mandate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and

environmental and energy policy should remove, not build, obstacles to the abundant, affordable energy necessary to lift the world’s poor out of poverty and sustain prosperity for all.

We also gladly join others in embracing An Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHAPTER ONE:

THEOLOGY, WORLDVIEW, AND ETHICS OF GLOBAL WARMING POLICY

Earth and all its subsystems—of land, sea, and air, living and nonliving—are the good products of the wise design and omnipotent acts of the infinite, eternal, and unchangeable Triune God of the Bible. As such they reveal God’s glory. Mankind, created in God’s image, is the crown of creation. Human beings have the divine mandate to multiply and to fill, subdue, and rule the Earth, transforming it from wilderness into garden. They act as stewards under God to cultivate and guard what they subdue and rule. Calling them to be His vicegerents over the Earth, God requires obedience to His laws—in Scripture and imprinted in the human conscience—in their stewardship. Although sin, universal among mankind, deeply mars this stewardship, God’s redemptive act in Jesus Christ’s death on the cross and His instructive activity through Scripture, communicating the nature of creation and human responsibility for it, enable people to create wealth and decrease poverty at the same time that they pursue creation stewardship and, even more important, the true spiritual wealth of knowing their Creator through Jesus Christ.

The Biblical worldview contrasts sharply with the environmentalist worldview—whether secular or religious—in many significant ways. Among these, four are particularly germane:

Environmentalism sees Earth and its systems as the product of chance and therefore fragile, subject to easy and catastrophic disruption. The Biblical worldview sees Earth and its systems as robust, self-regulating, and self-correcting, not immune to harm but durable.

Environmentalism sees human beings principally as consumers and polluters who are only quantitatively, not qualitatively, different from other species. The Bible sees people as made in God’s image, qualitatively different from all other species, and designed to be producers and stewards who, within a just and free social order, can create more resources than they consume and ensure a clean, healthful, and beautiful environment.

Environmentalism tends to view nature untouched by human hands as optimal, while the Bible teaches that it can be improved by wise and holy human action.

Environmentalism tends to substitute subjective, humanist standards of environmental stewardship for the objective, transcendent standards of divine morality.

This Biblical vision anticipates the development of environmentally friendly prosperity through the wise application of knowledge and skill to the raw materials of this world and the just ordering of society. That is, it anticipates the achievement of high levels of economic development and the reduction of poverty along with reductions in resource scarcity, pollution, and other environmental hazards.

The providence and promises of God inform a Christian understanding of creation stewardship, helping to avert irrational or exaggerated fears of catastrophes—fears that are rooted, ultimately, in the loss of faith in God. Those who do trust God are able to assess and respond to risks rationally. God’s wisdom, power, and faithfulness justify confidence that Earth’s ecosystems are robust and will, by God’s providence, accomplish the purposes He set for them.

Sound policymaking requires both moral and prudential (cost/benefit) analysis. In this, a high priority for the church should be the welfare of the poor, since environmental policies often adversely affect them. That is the case with policies intended to reduce global warming by reducing the use of fossil fuels. For example, such fuels are currently the most abundant and affordable alternatives to dirty fuels, like wood and dung, which are now used by two billion people and cause millions of deaths and hundreds of millions of illnesses from respiratory diseases contracted by breathing their smoke. Insisting on the use of more expensive alternative fuels because of global warming fears means depriving the poor of the abundant, affordable energy they need to rise from abject poverty and its attendant miseries. Such policies fail both moral and prudential tests.

Environmental policies the world’s poor most need will aim not at reducing global temperature (over which human action has little control) but at reducing specific risks to the poor regardless of temperature: communicable diseases (especially malaria), malnutrition and hunger, and exclusion from worldwide markets by trade restrictions. Money diverted from these goals to fight global warming will be wasted, while the poor will suffer increased and prolonged misery. Overall economic policy toward the poor should focus on promoting economic development, including making low-cost energy available, through which they can lift themselves out of poverty. It should not focus on wealth redistribution, which fosters dependency and slows development. Above all, the poor—and all other persons—need the gospel of salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHAPTER TWO:

THE SCIENCE OF GLOBAL WARMING

When people ask, “Do you believe in global warming?” chances are they mean, “Do you believe human beings are causing global warming?” It is unfortunate that global warming has become synonymous withglobal warming, because it obfuscates the real question: To what extent are human beings contributing to changes that are always occurring in nature anyway?

Some people claim repeatedly that melting sea ice, an increase in global-average temperatures, stronger storms, more floods, and more droughts are occurring due to humanity’s burning of fossil fuels. But how many of these changes are real versus imagined? And of those that are real, how much, if at all, can they be attributed to human activities?

Indeed, there have been some significant climatic changes in recent decades. For instance, the normal summer melt-back of Arctic sea ice has increased in the 30 years during which we have had satellites to monitor this remote region of the Earth. There has also been a slow and irregular warming trend of global-average temperatures over the last 50 to 100 years—the same period of time the carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the atmosphere has increased.

But correlation does not mean causation, and there has been a tendency in the media to overlook research suggesting that these recent changes are, in fact, related to natural cycles in the climate system rather than to atmospheric CO2 increases from fossil fuel use. That changes occur does not mean human beings are responsible. There is good evidence that most of the warming of the past 150 years is due to natural causes. The belief that climate change is anthropogenic (human-caused) and will have catastrophic consequences is highly speculative.

Recent progress in climate research suggests that:

Observed warming and purported dangerous effects have been overstated.

Earth’s climate is less sensitive to the addition of CO2 than the alleged scientific consensus claims it to be, which means that climate model predictions of future warming are exaggerated.

Those climate changes that have occurred are consistent with natural cycles driven by internal changes in the climate system itself, external changes in solar activity, or both.

In fact, given that CO2 in the atmosphere is necessary for life on Earth to exist, it is likely that more CO2 will be beneficial. This possibility is rarely discussed because many environmental activists share the quasi-religious belief that everything mankind does hurts the environment. Yet, if we objectively analyze the scientific evidence, we find good evidence that more CO2 could lead to greater abundance and diversity of life on Earth.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHAPTER THREE:

THE ECONOMICS OF GLOBAL WARMING POLICY

Many economists who have published articles on the subject consider the science of climate change a settled matter—that human beings are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions that cause dangerous global warming. We are aware of no economic models that take into account the possibility that human influence on climate is negligible. If this argument is correct—and we believe it is (see the science chapter)—then the justification for governments’ pursuing greenhouse gas reductions in the name of climate control collapse.

While we believe that human influence on climate is negligible, our task is to assess the economic prudence of policy options offered on the contrary assumption.

Although some sector-level economic studies in agriculture and forestry indicate that warming might enhance well-being, most models find that human well-being improves because of economic growth with or without warming but improves less with significant warming. Even so, economists conclude that an optimal climate policy, assuming there should be one, would avoid locking into a particular technology. Nonetheless, most energy legislation does just that. Economists also recommend against stopping climate change entirely, favoring a policy ramp whereby carbon taxes or emission reduction targets slowly increase as and if average global temperatures rise. But the optimal policy recommendations are based on projected future temperatures from climate models rather than observed temperatures, on the basis of which less warming might be expected.

On the assumption that politicians will seek to force reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, economists generally favor taxes over cap and trade as the means. Carbon taxes are (1) transparent so that citizens can recognize them, (2) flexible so they can be adjusted as needed (e.g., tied to average global temperatures), and (3) widely applicable (including across countries). Their revenues can be used to reduce other taxes, thereby possibly providing a double dividend (reduced CO2 emissions and economic growth due to removal of other taxes). In contrast, cap and trade leaves room for unjustified credits because of government and business corruption and dubious activities such as forest conservation and tree planting; it gives large emitters huge windfalls in the form of free permits early in the regime unless all emission permits are auctioned by the government; and it yields no double dividend. Both large industrial emitters and financial institutions, unsurprisingly, lobby hard for cap and trade—the former benefiting from the windfall at the start, the latter from transaction fees in a commodity market that could be worth $3 trillion annually. Their support for climate policies must not be mistaken, however, for conviction either that dangerous manmade warming is real or that the policies are the best way to respond. It is rent seeking: lobbying for legislation to profit from potentially massive, policy-created windfalls.

Finally, many supporters of mandated emission reductions assume that price-competitive renewable energy sources will soon displace fossil fuels. However, large technical obstacles need to be overcome before renewable energy will become price competitive on global or national scales—a process that might take 50 to 100 years or more.

In light of these considerations and those of the other two chapters of this document, we recommend against mandated reductions on CO2 emissions—whether through cap and trade (the worst kind of emissions reduction policy) or a carbon tax (the least bad emissions reduction policy, but still not good)—and for the promotion of economic development and targeted problem solving (e.g., disease reduction and nutrition enhancement) as a means to fortify people the world over—especially the poor—against material threats to their well-being, whether from climate change or anything else.

PREAMBLE

As governments consider policies to fight alleged man-made global warming, evangelical leaders have a responsibility to be well informed, and then to speak out. A Renewed Call to Truth, Prudence, and Protection of the Poor: An Evangelical Examination of the Theology, Science, and Economics of Global Warming demonstrates that many of these proposed policies would destroy jobs and impose trillions of dollars in costs to achieve no net benefits. They could be implemented only by enormous and dangerous expansion of government control over private life. Worst of all, by raising energy prices and hindering economic development, they would slow or stop the rise of the world’s poor out of poverty and so condemn millions to premature death.

WHAT WE BELIEVE

We believe Earth and its ecosystems—created by God’s intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by His faithful providence —are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting, admirably suited for human flourishing, and displaying His glory. Earth’s climate system is no exception. Recent global warming is one of many natural cycles of warming and cooling in geologic history. We believe abundant, affordable energy is indispensable to human flourishing, particularly to societies which are rising out of abject poverty and the high rates of disease and premature death that accompany it. With present technologies, fossil and nuclear fuels are indispensable if energy is to be abundant and affordable. We believe mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, achievable mainly by greatly reduced use of fossil fuels, will greatly increase the price of energy and harm economies. We believe such policies will harm the poor more than others because the poor spend a higher percentage of their income on energy and desperately need economic growth to rise out of poverty and overcome its miseries.

WHAT WE DENY

We deny that Earth and its ecosystems are the fragile and unstable products of chance, and particularly that Earth’s climate system is vulnerable to dangerous alteration because of minuscule changes in atmospheric chemistry. Recent warming was neither abnormally large nor abnormally rapid. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human contribution to greenhouse gases is causing dangerous global warming. We deny that alternative, renewable fuels can, with present or near-term technology, replace fossil and nuclear fuels, either wholly or in significant part, to provide the abundant, affordable energy necessary to sustain prosperous economies or overcome poverty. We deny that carbon dioxide—essential to all plant growth—is a pollutant. Reducing greenhouse gases cannot achieve significant reductions in future global temperatures, and the costs of the policies would far exceed the benefits. We deny that such policies, which amount to a regressive tax, comply with the Biblical requirement of protecting the poor from harm and oppression.

A CALL TO ACTION

In light of these facts,

We call on our fellow Christians to practice creation stewardship out of Biblical conviction, adoration for our Creator, and love for our fellow man—especially the poor. We call on Christian leaders to understand the truth about climate change and embrace Biblical thinking, sound science, and careful economic analysis in creation stewardship. We call on political leaders to adopt policies that protect human liberty, make energy more affordable, and free the poor to rise out of poverty, while abandoning fruitless, indeed harmful policies to control global temperature.

ENDORSEMENT

While our signatures express our endorsement only of this Declaration and do not imply agreement with every point in A Renewed Call to Truth, we believe that document provides ample justification for it. We call on scholars and experts to join us in signing this Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming.

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. All creation belongs to Him (Genesis 1:1; Psalm 24:1).

Though God reveals Himself in creation, the Bible, and His one and only Son, Jesus Christ, He is distinct from and transcendent over creation (Romans 1:25). Those who deny the Creator/creature distinction become futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts are darkened (Romans 1:21).

God made man, male and female, in His own image (Genesis 1:26–27). No other terrestrial life form bears the image of God or is of equal value or priority with human beings (Matthew 10:29–31). Though the earth is the LORD’s, He has also given it to men (Psalm 115:16) and mandated that they be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, subdue it, and have dominion over everything that lives in it (Genesis 1:28). Therefore human dominion over the earth is, in principle, not sinful, and the possibility of its abuse does not negate the righteousness of its proper use.

Earth and its physical and biological systems are the “very good” effects of God’s omniscient design, omnipotent creation, and faithful sustaining (Genesis 1:31). God would not have made earth susceptible to catastrophic degradation from proportionally small causes. Consequently, wise environmental stewardship will not readily embrace claims of catastrophe stemming from such causes.

Godly human dominion over the earth means men and women, created in the image of God, laboring together to enhance earth’s safety, fruitfulness, and beauty, to the glory of God and the benefit of our neighbors. It does not mean humans are servants rather than masters of the earth. When God had created Adam, He placed him in the Garden of Eden, which is distinct from the rest of the earth, to cultivate and guard it (Genesis 2:15). The instruction to “cultivate and guard” the Garden does not mean, as some modern environmentalists allege, either that man is to “serve and protect” or “worship and protect” the Garden or the earth, or that man is to “worship and hear” God either directly or through the earth or its parts.

A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between God’s placing Adam in the Garden to cultivate and guard it (Genesis 2:15) and His commanding Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue and rule everything in it (Genesis 1:28) entails a growing population that spreads out from the Garden to transform wilderness into garden and ultimately garden city (Revelation 21:2; 22:1–3). Biblical earth stewardship, or godly dominion, is not limited to keeping earth in the condition in which we find it. It follows that the common environmentalist belief that “Nature knows best,” that its transformation by humans is in principle wrong or harmful, is false.

God placed minerals, plants, and animals in and on the earth for His pleasure, to reveal His glory and elicit man’s praise, and to serve human needs through godly use (Genesis 2:5–16; 4:22; Numbers 31:21–23; Job 38–41; Psalm 19:1–6; Psalm 104). One way of exercising godly dominion is by transforming raw materials into resources and using them to meet human needs.

Because of man’s fall into sin, we often fall into materialism, covetousness, and selfish accumulation of possessions (Luke 12:16–21; 1 Timothy 6:10; Colossians 3:5). This does not, however, entail that the production of wealth is sinful. While man is accountable to God’s judgment in all he does with the earth, this does not justify abolishing private property (Exodus 20:15, 17), adopting collectivist economic institutions, or delegating to civil governments—whether local, national, or global—ownership or control of land, natural resources, or private property.

The fall into sin (Genesis 3) led to human abuse of the earth and of fellow humans. In response to man’s sin God cursed the ground so that it would not yield easily even to godly dominion, let alone to ungodly, abusive domination (Genesis 3:17–19). He subjected the whole cosmos to decay and corruption. But He is restoring it, partly in history by obedience to the dominion mandate (Genesis 1:28; Romans 8:18–24), and fully in the New Heavens and New earth of the eschaton (Revelation 21:1–3, 22–27; 22:1–5). All of this is secured by the redeeming death and resurrection of Christ (Colossians 1:14–20). God’s curse on the earth negates neither the dominion mandate (Genesis 1:28) nor the robustness and self-correcting resilience of the God-sustained earth.Due to God’s faithfulness to His covenant, in which He proclaimed, after the Flood, that He would sustain the cycles on which terrestrial life depends (Genesis 8:22), godly dominion remains possible.

Human multiplication and filling of the earth are intrinsically good (Genesis 1:28). In principle, children, lots of them, are a blessing from God (Psalm 127; 128).Earth is not overpopulated; indeed, “overpopulation” is a meaningless term, since it cannot be defined by demographic quantities like population density, growth rate, or age distribution. Hence, godly dominion does not require population control or “family planning.” People are not primarily consumers and polluters but, as the image of God implies, producers and stewards.

When the Bible speaks of God’s judgment on human societies because they have “polluted the land,” the “pollution” in mind is consistently not chemical or biological but moral—the pollution of idolatry, adultery, murder, oppression of the weak, and other violations of the moral law of God expressed in the Ten Commandments (Psalm 106:38; Jeremiah 3:1–10; 16:18). This does not, however, mean that we are free to harm our neighbors and the earth by careless disposal of what we more typically think of as pollution. The commandments against murder and theft, which by implication also prohibit our intentionally or negligently injuring our neighbors or harming their property, prohibit that.

Because of sin and the curse, risk is inherent in every human activity (Hebrews 9:27), so it is proper to balance risk against risk.Cost/benefit analysis (Luke 14:28) is an important aspect of godly dominion (Proverbs 14:4). The mere existence of risk does not make an activity immoral. Proper environmental prioritization will address greater risks before lesser risks. Since resources spent to reduce one risk cannot be used to reduce another, it is wise to allocate resources where they will achieve the greatest risk reduction. Environmental policies that address relatively minor risks while harming the poor—such as opposition to the use of abundant, affordable, reliable energy sources like fossil fuels in the name of fighting global warming; the suppression of the use of safe, affordable, and effective insecticides like DDT to reduce malaria in the name of protecting biodiversity; and the conversion of vast amounts of corn and other agricultural products into engine fuel in the name of ecological protection—oppress the poor and are unjust.

Because a clean, safe, healthful, beautiful environment is a costly good, wealthy societies can better afford environmental protection and restoration than poor societies. Economic development is, therefore, not a threat to environmental quality but an indispensable precondition of it. Private ownership of land and other resources, because it harnesses God-given human incentives to overcome the “tragedy of the commons,” is the best institutional economic system for environmental protection.Collective economic systems are comparatively poor at protecting and improving natural environments.

Intentional exaggeration, as practiced by many environmental advocacy organizations, or minimization, as practiced by many industries, of environmental risks or the effectiveness of various means of addressing them is sinful.

Godly dominion is a responsibility for everyone at all times, regardless of eschatological perspective. Our obligation to love our neighbors requires godly dominion, whether the earth is to remain and be transformed, or be annihilated and replaced, and whether Christ’s second coming and the final judgment are moments away or thousands of years ahead.

[Editor’s note: Dierdre McCloskey is one of the world’s foremost economic historians, whose many books have provided extraordinary insights into how societies rise from poverty to prosperity and remain prosperous. We are grateful for Dr. McCloskey’s permission to reprint this article, which first appeared in the New York Times and then was republished on the website of the American Institute for Economic Research.—E.C.B.]

The world is rich and will become still richer. Quit worrying.



Not all of us are rich yet, of course. A billion or so people on the planet drag along on the equivalent of $3 a day or less. But as recently as 1800, almost everybody did.



The Great Enrichment began in 17th-century Holland. By the 18th century, it had moved to England, Scotland and the American colonies, and now it has spread to much of the rest of the world.



Economists and historians agree on its startling magnitude: By 2010, the average daily income in a wide range of countries, including Japan, the United States, Botswana, and Brazil, had soared 1,000 to 3,000 percent over the levels of 1800. People moved from tents and mud huts to split-levels and city condominiums, from waterborne diseases to 80-year life spans, from ignorance to literacy.



You might think the rich have become richer and the poor even poorer. But by the standard of basic comfort in essentials, the poorest people on the planet have gained the most. In places like Ireland, Singapore, Finland, and Italy, even people who are relatively poor have adequate food, education, lodging, and medical care—none of which their ancestors had. Not remotely.



Inequality of financial wealth goes up and down, but over the long term it has been reduced. Financial inequality was greater in 1800 and 1900 than it is now, as even the French economist Thomas Piketty has acknowledged. By the more important standard of basic comfort in consumption, inequality within and between countries has fallen nearly continuously.



In any case, the problem is poverty, not inequality as such—not how many yachts the L’Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt has, but whether the average Frenchwoman has enough to eat. At the time of Les Misérables, she didn’t. In the last 40 years, the World Bank estimates, the proportion of the population living on an appalling $1 or $2 a day has halved. Paul Collier, an Oxford economist, urges us to help the “bottom billion” of the more than seven billion people on earth. Of course. It is our duty. But he notes that 50 years ago, four billion out of five billion people lived in such miserable conditions. In 1800, it was 95 percent of one billion.



We can improve the conditions of the working class. Raising low productivity by enabling human creativity is what has mainly worked. By contrast, taking from the rich and giving to the poor helps only a little—and anyway expropriation is a one-time trick. Enrichment from market-tested betterment will go on and on and, over the next century or so, will bring comfort in essentials to virtually everyone on the planet, and more to an expanding middle class.



Look at the astonishing improvements in China since 1978 and in India since 1991. Between them, they are home to about four out of every 10 humans. Even in the United States, real wages have continued in recent decades to grow—if slowly—contrary to what you might have heard. Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University, and others who have looked beyond the superficial have shown that real wages are continuing to rise, thanks largely to major improvements in the quality of goods and services, and to nonwage benefits. Real purchasing power is double what it was in the fondly remembered 1950s—when many American children went to bed hungry.



What, then, caused this Great Enrichment?



Not exploitation of the poor, not investment, not existing institutions, but a mere idea, which the philosopher and economist Adam Smith called “the liberal plan of equality, liberty and justice.” In a word, it was liberalism, in the free-market European sense. Give masses of ordinary people equality before the law and equality of social dignity, and leave them alone, and it turns out that they become extraordinarily creative and energetic.



The liberal idea was spawned by some happy accidents in northwestern Europe from 1517 to 1789—namely, the four R’s: the Reformation, the Dutch Revolt, the revolutions of England and France, and the proliferation of reading. The four R’s liberated ordinary people, among them the venturing bourgeoisie. The Bourgeois Deal is, briefly, this: In the first act, let me try this or that improvement. I’ll keep the profit, thank you very much, though in the second act those pesky competitors will erode it by entering and disrupting (as Uber has done to the taxi industry). By the third act, after my betterments have spread, they will make you rich.



And they did.



You may object that ideas are a dime a dozen and that to make them fruitful we must start with adequate physical and human capital and good institutions. It’s a popular idea at the World Bank, but a mistaken one. True, we eventually need capital and institutions to embody the ideas, such as a marble building with central heating and cooling to house the Supreme Court. But the intermediate and dependent causes like capital and institutions have not been the root cause.



The root cause of enrichment was and is the liberal idea, spawning the university, the railway, the high-rise, the internet and, most important, our liberties. What original accumulation of capital inflamed the minds of William Lloyd Garrison and Sojourner Truth? What institutions, except the recent liberal ones of university education and uncensored book publishing, caused feminism or the antiwar movement? Since Karl Marx, we have made a habit of seeking material causes for human progress. But the modern world came from treating more and more people with respect.



Ideas are not all sweet, of course. Fascism, racism, eugenics, and nationalism are ideas with alarming recent popularity. But sweet practical ideas for profitable technologies and institutions, and the liberal idea that allowed ordinary people for the first time to have a go, caused the Great Enrichment. We need to inspirit masses of people, not the elite, who are plenty inspirited already. Equality before the law and equality of social dignity are still the root of economic, as well as spiritual, flourishing—whatever tyrants may think to the contrary.

https://cornwallalliance.org/2021/01/most-didnt-know-it-but-those-who-voted-for-biden-voted-for-electric-vehicles/,"Most Didn’t Know It, But Those Who Voted for Biden Voted for Electric Vehicles",Duggan Flanakin,2021-01-11 15:32:29+00:00,,"The Big Switch will massively change America

The election of the Biden-Harris ticket will, we are told, hasten the death of the internal combustion engine in the United States. Once the sale of new gasoline engine vehicles is banned, the only question remaining is how long before driving them is also outlawed? Well, incoming Vice President Kamala Harris promised that, “By my plan, by 2045 we will have basically zero emission vehicles only.100 percent by 2045.”

President-elect Biden has promised in his two trillion dollar “climate change” plan [a major downsize from Bernie Sanders’ $16 trillion Green New Deal] “rigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100 percent of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be zero emission vehicles (ZEVs).” Harris has called for this ban to begin by 2035, perhaps even sooner, if the momentum for change continues.



To jumpstart the transformation of the 99.5 percent of the U.S. vehicle fleet that are not ZEVs, Biden ally Sen. Chuck Schumer plans to introduce legislation authorizing $$454 billion “cash for clunkers” incentives or rebates to people to enable them to replace gasoline-powered vehicles with all-electric vehicles (EVs). The plan also includes building half a million new EV battery charging stations, along with replacing the entire U.S. government vehicle fleet with EVs.

Not since Henry Ford introduced the assembly line for his Model T in 1913 has America faced such a transition in transportation. But the Big Switch to an all-EV fleet will bring massive changes to American society. It will create new winners and new losers, make owning any vehicle a near impossibility for the transient and poor, and shift the balance of world power away from its long-term dependence on “the free flow of oil at market prices.”

The Big Switch has been in the works for years. As early as 2017, many countries had already announced dates for internal combustion engine (ICE) bans. Norway clarified that its 2025 date was just a “suggestion,” but Germany, France, and the United Kingdom had set “firm” dates of 2040 while the Netherlands had pushed the funeral to 2030. Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Portugal, South Korea, and Spain had also set dates, as had India – and several American states.

Major automakers, too, have pledged to end ICE vehicle production soon, even though polls in 2017 showing that only 30 percent of millennials (and much lower percentages of older drivers) were willing to invest in an electric vehicle. This despite claims by economist Tilak Doshi (among others) that after 50,000 miles on the road, the typical EV has been responsible for 76 percent as much carbon dioxide emissions as a gasoline-powered vehicle.

As renowned economist Bjorn Lomborg had explained in 2013, EV batteries are the product of emission-intensive mining operations (which in some cases involve children laboring in very dirty air) and the electricity for recharging these batteries involves additional CO 2 emissions. So the term “zero emission vehicles” is really a misnomer, as the emissions are just transferred from the wealthy West to developing nations or rural America.

The Big Switch also signals major declines in jobs in the oil and gas industry, declining revenues for convenience stores that profit from gasoline sales, and significant manufacturing cost increases for petrochemicals, automobile and truck tires, roof shingles, plastics, and a host of other consumer products that rely on oil refineries for raw materials.

Many also state that the electric vehicle mandates will ultimately harm the auto repair and auto insurance industries. The EV has maybe 20 moving parts, compared with 2,000 for ICE vehicles, but these parts tend to be more expensive and in the short run at least less readily available. This suggests that EVs needing repairs will sit longer at the garage (at the garage’s expense). Any delays in parts availability thus add to the holistic cost of vehicle maintenance. But will insurers cover these added costs?

The Big Switch will also mandate major shifts in tax policy for local and state governments and the federal government, all of which rely heavily on gasoline taxes to cover the costs of highway maintenance. The 18.4 cents per gallon federal excise tax funds the Highway Trust Fund that pays for infrastructure and transportation costs (with a separate small tax covering remediation of leaking underground storage tanks).

As gasoline sales continue to decline, will Washington find a way to replace this lost revenue? [Given that we are also entering the era of the driverless vehicle, one wonders how these computer-driven behemoths will handle massive potholes?]

Highways maintained by state and local gasoline taxes are already threatened from declining revenues, thanks to higher mileage vehicles (including EVs and hybrids), and the 2020 pandemic that cut highway driving by 64 percent in April 2020 (and significantly ever since). Some states have already begun adding or increasing registration fees for electric vehicles. Alabama’s fee is $200 for EVs and $100 for plug-in hybrids, a quarter of which will fund EV charging stations, while California began imposing a $100 annual fee last July.



But that’s not all. People today can purchase an older gasoline-powered vehicle that will pass inspection for well under $2,000. Batteries for these vehicles cost under $200, and many of the older vehicles are capable of being repaired by amateur mechanics. But replacing an EV battery can cost from $1,000 up to $6,000, making even used electric vehicles unaffordable for tens of millions of Americans in a nation half of whose vehicles are over 10 years old.

The Biden-Harris promises may be tough to fully deliver. As recently as 2017, industry experts projected that EVs can only achieve 25 percent of worldwide vehicles by 2050. The Biden-Harris plan also includes a total phaseout of fossil fuels for producing electricity coupled with the significant increase in electricity needed to keep EVs moving. Even if the new visionaries accept nuclear energy as a “renewable” (or at least zero emissions) fuel, bringing sufficient new nuclear power plants online to impact overall energy needs will take decades.

But then again, when did Moscow or Beijing ever meet all objectives of their Five-Year Plans?"
https://cornwallalliance.org/2020/12/whitehouses-call-for-a-climate-inquisition-undermines-scientific-research/,Whitehouse’s Call For A Climate Inquisition Undermines Scientific Research,H. Sterling Burnett,2020-12-16 16:07:44+00:00,,"Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is hostile to open debate over climate science and policy. Sadly, he’s far from being the only one. Many progressive Democrats, and their lapdogs in the mainstream media, have long been calling for a climate inquisition: prosecution, fines, imprisonment, and reeducation camps for economists, scientists, and political analysts whose research has led them to question whether humans are causing a climate catastrophe or that big government must impose harsh restrictions on the public in order to prevent it.

Whitehouse first broached the possibility of suppressing the speech of and possibly prosecuting climate dissenters as far back as 2015 in a Washington Post article. His home state’s largest paper, the Providence Journal, called the senator to the carpet for this threat, writing,

A civil proceeding by the government, as well as a criminal one, is a form of prosecution. While we strongly believe humans are contributing to climate change, it is our position that disagreements about policy issues and scientific theories should not be turned into grounds for investigations by government officials into supposed fraud, because that undermines the First Amendment and has a chilling effect on free speech. We believe, with the founders who listed this essential freedom first in the Bill of Rights, that open discussion and disagreements are healthy, allowing people to learn, grow and embrace or reject new ideas, as well as to safely challenge the misconduct of government officials and other forms of injustice.

Whitehouse should be especially sensitive to concerns that his actions as a senator would endanger free speech and open debate: when he became a senator, he swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, which includes the First Amendment ensuring, among other things, the rights of free speech and association and the right to dispute government policies. In addition, the state Whitehouse represents was founded by dissenters—people fleeing neighboring states (colonies at the time) where their religious and political views were being suppressed through the force of law.

In his quest for the title of Grand Climate Inquisitor, Whitehouse is evidently willing to ignore history and the nation’s charter. As my friend and colleague Paul Driessen has noted, Whitehouse recently said if Democrats win Georgia’s two contested U.S. Senate seats, allowing them to take over leadership of the Senate, it “would enable him and his colleagues to launch investigations, haul climate realists before committees (for star-chamber show trials), and even employ grand juries and criminal prosecutions—to intimidate, silence and punish climate crisis nonbelievers.”

As I mentioned earlier, Whitehouse is by no means alone in his authoritarian quest to squelch debate over the causes and consequences of climate change and possible policy responses to it. Obama administration Attorney General Loretta Lynch testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2016 that the Department of Justice had discussed pursuing legal action against companies, research institutes, and scientists who debate whether humans are causing catastrophic climate change.

Before that, Robert Kennedy Jr. called for trying climate realists as war criminals, a proposal TV personality Bill Nye said was worth considering. Nye said, “As a taxpayer and voter, the introduction of this extreme doubt about climate change is affecting my quality of life as a public citizen. … So I can see where people are very concerned about this, and they’re pursuing criminal investigations as well as engaging in discussions like this. … That there is a chilling effect on scientists who are in extreme doubt about climate change, I think that is good.”

Nye long ago became nothing more than a closeminded political hack, a man who gives science a bad name despite being a self-proclaimed “science guy.”

Media talking heads all too often decry the First Amendment’s acknowledgment of an inherent freedom of speech, while cloaking themselves in its protections of press freedom when it comes to expressing their own opinions or protecting sources. Social networking platforms such as Facebook, Google, and YouTube often censor speech or positions, including the view that humans may not be causing dangerous climate change, that their founders or advertisers don’t like, despite claiming under law they are neutral platforms for the free exchange of ideas. This is troubling and should lead people to question the value of continuing to listen to or use such media outlets or social media platforms. Even worse, though, is when people in political authority, people with guns and prisons backing them up, call for suppressing scientific or political speech. That should spark outrage in Americans of all political and social persuasions.

For more than 200 years, the First Amendment has protected the right of individuals and groups to speak freely on issues of public importance, including global climate change, even if politically connected renewable power interests, influential environmentalist funders, members of Congress, and even the president of the United States disagree with them.

In addition, cases brought against climate skeptics should be quickly thrown out of court, because the truth is an absolute defense against claims of fraud. It is impossible for Whitehouse and his fellow politically powerful bullies to show skeptical scientists and researchers are lying when they say the human impact on climate is unclear and evidence of harm is lacking, because the matter is still part of an ongoing, lively debate.

The German climate science site No Tricks Zone has documented thousands of peer-reviewed academic articles published since 2014 disputing claims made by climate change alarmists. These papers show nature plays a significant role in climate change, increasing amounts of carbon dioxide are improving plant growth, and, contrary to climate model projections, weather extremes are not getting worse because of climate change. These articles make clear, individually and collectively, the debate over the causes and consequences of climate change is not closed.

A 2016 survey of members of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) found 67 percent of its members believe humans are responsible for more than half of climate change. This survey was conducted after Whitehouse first began to push for climate prosecutions and while Lynch was dreaming up plans for Justice Department action against those expressing skepticism about the extent and effects of human-caused climate change. Are we to believe the 33 percent of AMS members who disagree humans are primarily responsible for climate change are committing fraud?

For centuries, educated people believed illnesses were caused by an imbalance of “humors” (fluids) in the body, the world was flat, and the Earth was the center of the universe. Those people were wrong; they were not frauds.

Everyone who currently disputes humans are causing dangerous climate change could be completely wrong and may be shown to be so as more evidence comes in. Similarly, those who believe fossil fuel use is causing a climate apocalypse could be wrong. But being wrong on a scientific matter does not constitute fraud. Debate is the scientific method in action.

By raising the specter of prosecution, Whitehouse and his ilk are trying, as Nye approvingly recognized, forcibly to silence those who disagree with them on climate matters. This vile effort undermines free speech and open enquiry, the very underpinnings of successful democracies and the scientific method.

When government can dictate which questions are open or closed—in either the political sphere or the scientific realm—the gulags cannot be far behind.

Meanwhile, as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency celebrates its fiftieth birthday, political battles continue to rage over the extent of public, executive and congressional oversight, and access to research files, original data and other information used by the agency in taking legal actions against individuals, institutions and businesses. The latest salvos involve the first-ever “transparency” requirements for EPA guidance documents – requirements likely to be tossed out by a Biden Administration.

In October 2019, President Trump signed an executive order to curb what he called abuses of authority by unaccountable bureaucrats who were “imposing their private agendas” on Americans.“A permanent federal bureaucracy,” he observed, “cannot become a fourth branch of government unanswerable to American voters.” Nor should federal agencies be able to impose multi-billion-dollar regulations, while claiming studies used to justify them are proprietary, confidential or otherwise inaccessible.

This February, the EPA launched a new searchable portal to provide public access to agency guidance documents. When it was finalized in July, the EPA brought over 9,000 guidance documents out of the darkness and made the entire active guidance library available to the public for the first time.

in September, the EPA finalized a rule that significantly increases the transparency of guidance practices and amends the agency’s process for managing guidance documents. The rule establishes the first formal public petition process for asking the EPA to modify, withdraw or reinstate a guidance document.

You would think “transparency” would be universally practiced and praised. However, the Deep State, science establishment, activist and pressure groups, and Democratic Party politicians have been horrified. Some claimed the rule reveals and distorts EPA’s decision-making processes. Others said it risks exposing private medical data and other confidential information. Still others carped that the rule is a bad-faith ploy to hamstring the agency’s ability to regulate industries and individuals.

Indeed, last October, an unsigned article in Wired magazine (we can’t even have author transparency) claimed the regulation was a Zombie-like attempt to resurrect the Secret Science Reform Act. Horrors!

The proposed legislation merely attempted to end the EPA’s widespread practice of basing regulations and guidance on research whose details remain hidden behind confidentiality agreements and are not publicly accessible, and whose research data cannot be replicated or independently verified.

During Congressional hearings on the proposal, critics claimed transparency would force the EPA to exclude important studies to protect confidentiality agreements. FactCheck.org found that private data sometimes cannot be redacted. But it also acknowledged that the rule allows the EPA administrator to exempt regulations if releasing study data publicly (rarely) does conflict with protecting privacy. It also allows for alternatives to complete public release if the data actually include confidential information.

One of the most scandalous cases of regulatory secrecy (and presidential secrecy) involved the acid rain provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. President Bush and the EPA suppressed the findings of the 10-year, $537 million National Acid Rain Assessment Program (NAPAP), which had been authorized by President Carter.

To gain public support for the legislation, EPA scientists conjured up scary scenarios, claiming that sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants combined with water in the air to form acid rain that polluted streams, lakes and rivers and damaged trees, wildlife and buildings. The NAPAP found that the acidity of a lake is determined as much (or more) by the acidity of local soil and vegetation as it is by acidic rain. The frightening scenarios were wildly exaggerated, to justify closing power plants.

Moreover, many of these lakes were historically acidic and fishless until around 1900, when logging removed the acid vegetation and made the soil slightly alkaline. After logging slowed to a halt (around 1915), the naturally acidic decaying vegetation built up again, and the lakes became acidic again. In many cases forests were also debilitated due to insects or drought – not acid rain.

Curiously, a 1991 paper by environmental law scholar Richard Lazarus argued that Congress should let EPA be more independent, while admitting that legislators and regulators alike “have rarely known the best way to respond to an environmental pollution problem at the time a statute was passed.” Lazarus further claimed, “Statutory prescription therefore is an especially risky endeavor [that] can lead to wasteful expenditures for pollution control and … to more, rather than less, environmental degradation.”

These realities, Lazarus argued, make congressional oversight problematical, especially because the scientific options proposed by regulators for solving pollution often conflict with the political interests of lawmakers. True. But what if the legislators’ science is corrupted by “dark money” and the perpetual quest for more agency funding? Or if the regulators’ science is corrupted or weaponized by White House or Deep State biases, agendas, censoring of certain views, or manipulation or fabrication of data?

A 2018 CFACT report assessed the extent of the public information problem, noting that EPA regulations have the force of law and constitute 25 percent of all federal regulations. Congress often grants regulatory bodies immense power over how people and businesses may operate, without giving targeted entities even the same level of due process that the law affords to criminal defendants. We should expect that EPA expands these overly broad mandates even further.

Indeed, the CFACT report contends, federal bureaucrats, and EPA administrators in particular, determine “who gets a permit to operate, and who does not; what technologies a business must use; what lightbulbs are available for your homes; what gas we can buy; what chemicals can be used; where companies can mine; what local land use decisions will survive; and even where a pond can be built on private property.”

It concluded: “While the President has massive powers over war and peace, and sets the operating philosophy of federal agencies, the EPA Administrator has direct power over the business operations … and thus the economy … of the entire nation.”

In creating the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in 2010, the Democrat-controlled Congress gave its director broad powers and virtual immunity from political scrutiny – with more power than the President. The Supreme Court only narrowly recognized this as an unconstitutional grant of power to an unelected official. The EPA Administrator’s powers should be equally restrained.

In a second October 2019 executive order, President Trump required that agencies inform individuals of regulatory cases against them, acknowledge their responses, and educate businesses about new regulatory impacts. This order too should be non-controversial, but could well be axed by a President Biden.

Under current law, those whose livelihoods are assaulted by regulatory bodies can challenge an agency in court only after the agency has sullied their reputations and prosecuted their alleged noncompliance. Even then, the environmental defendant typically loses, because courts have mostly upheld the agencies if their decisions are “rational,” even if (absent long-sought transparency) the agency has concealed any or all of its “public” (but secret) data and records that do not support its “reasoning.”

Ultimately, the future of EPA transparency (and openness in all government) rides on the final outcome of the 2020 Presidential election. It’s fascinating how entities that set arbitrary and ever-changing standards for “acceptable” speech, favor crude protests over peaceful assemblies, and seek to curtail entire industries – also see no reason to inform the public of the rationale behind their politicized “scientific” decisions on issues from climate change to COVID to all manner of environmental regulation."
https://cornwallalliance.org/2020/11/the-myth-of-glorious-renewables/,The Myth of Glorious Renewables,Vijay Jayaraj,2020-11-10 20:07:00+00:00,,"We all love energy solutions that make life better. It is an undeniable fact that coal propelled the Industrial Revolution and led to the alleviation of poverty in the West. More recently, the oil reserves in the Middle East have made it one of the most economically developed regions in the world.

Despite their continuous support to the global economy, these fossil fuel sources have now become unpopular among the climate-sensitive, anti-fossil fuel, green lobbyists and environmental enthusiasts. They’ve branded fossil fuel as “evil,” and the reason for the on-going “climate emergency.”

As an alternative, the mainstream media, celebrities, and a section of scientists ask us to embrace energy solutions like wind and solar, because they will make our future better. They ask us to accept renewables as the miracle energy solution that can meet global energy demands in a clean and green way. Interesting stories from poor countries—where stand-alone renewable systems power very small households—are often presented as evidence for renewables’ life-changing role among people who are not connected to the electricity grid.

The issue of replacing fossil fuels with renewables is important to the American presidential election. Democratic challenger Joe Biden has proposed a Clean Energy Plan that aims at spending trillions of dollars on developing renewable energy technology and ending fossil fuel use completely.

However, anti-fossil activists do not promote these new and popular renewable energy sources based on their proven effectiveness. Instead, they ask us to blindly trust the hypothetical benefits they claim renewables will bring in future.

The ground reality has been contrary to the glory that the mainstream media attribute to renewables.

Intermittent and Unreliable

The biggest problem with renewables is that they are unreliable. In energy terms, they are intermittent, owing to their nature of energy generation. Wind turbines are completely dependent on wind flow, can be very volatile when wind is inconsistent, and cease producing electricity during windless days and seasons.

Likewise, output from solar is also highly variable when there isn’t sufficient sunlight, and it stops completely after sunset.

Data on the annual change in energy generation reveal the overall volatility of renewable energy output—hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, wave and tidal, and bioenergy—at a macro-scale in the recent few decades. This volatility also increases the unpredictability with renewable energy output forecasts, resulting in overall uncertainty to power companies and consumers.

Besides, both wind and solar require adequate energy backup in the form of batteries. But currently available battery technology is not capable of supporting large renewable systems. Hence, major renewable generation units depend on backup support from other energy sources (like fossil fuel and nuclear) to make up for the loss in the energy grid.

The recent wildfires in California exposed the inefficiency of renewables, where widespread blackouts brought life to a standstill for thousands of customers. Governor Newsom said that gaps in renewable energy systems led to the blackout of millions of Californians.

More states are beginning to understand this inescapable intermittency problem with renewables. In the Pacific Northwest, Benton Public Utility District (PUD)—which serves 55,000 consumers—is now requesting the state authorities to refrain from installing more wind farms.

“We are continuing to sound the alarm regarding the unacceptably high risk of power grid blackouts in the Pacific Northwest being precipitated by overly aggressive clean energy policies and deepening dependence on wind power to replace retiring coal plants,” read a statement by Benton PUD.

They also stressed the need for critical evaluation in the midst of a renewable craze that is sweeping the states: “While development of wind farms may be politically fashionable and appeal to many in the general public as a harmonization of nature with electricity production, the science and economics indicate powering modern civilization with intermittent generation resources like wind and solar power comes at a high financial and environmental cost.”



Renewables Drain Your Bank



Analysis of power markets in a few European countries have shown that renewables played a major part in increasing electricity prices for domestic households. The same is true in the U.S.

California, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, and New York are not only the leading states for renewable energy in the U.S., they also boast some of the highest residential electricity prices in the country. There could be other factors that influence these high prices, but it is certain that renewable energy has played its part in raising the electricity prices in these states.

In the UK, renewables drove electricity prices higher and made energy access a luxury for many. Even the UK government acknowledges this, and millions of children and elderly Britons suffer regularly from unavailability of cheap power to heat their homes.

Dr. Alan Moran—a respected economist from Australia—evaluated the impact of Australia’s climate and renewable policy on the economy. The pro-renewable climate policy cost each household around 933 USD annually, accounted for 39 percent of household electricity bills, and caused a net loss of jobs in the economy.

It is also important to note that the cost of operating windmills has not come down in the last two decades despite the contrary claims. A study done on 350 onshore and offshore wind farms in the UK revealed that the operating costs have increased, not decreased, significantly in the last two decades.

Renewables Are Dirty

Renewables are dirty, but the mainstream media usually don’t admit it. They seldom address the proven toxicity of raw materials used in manufacturing of wind and solar energy generation units.

Besides, the end-of-life recycle factor is extremely poor for wind and solar. Decommissioned wind turbines are buried in mass landfills as they cannot be recycled. Wind turbines are also notorious for killing thousands of birds each year, including endangered raptor species.

The notion that renewables are “clean and green” has been nothing but a myth. So are the claims concerning their ability to produce reliable electricity for energy intensive commercial energy units and households in cities. The belief that they can somehow miraculously replace fossil fuels in the next decade and a half is a myth, too.

https://cornwallalliance.org/2020/11/study-suggests-no-more-co2-warming/,Study suggests no more CO2 warming,David WojickB. Dulock,2020-11-09 20:38:00+00:00,,"Precision research by physicists William Happer and William van Wijngaarden has determined that the present levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor are almost completely saturated. In radiation physics the technical term “saturated” implies that adding more molecules will not cause more warming.

In plain language this means that from now on our emissions from burning fossil fuels could have little or no further impact on global warming. There would be no climate emergency. No threat at all. We could emit as much CO2 as we like; with no effect.

This astounding finding resolves a huge uncertainty that has plagued climate science for over a century. How should saturation be measured and what is its extent with regard to the primary greenhouse gases?

In radiation physics the term “saturation” is nothing like the simple thing we call saturation in ordinary language, just as the greenhouse effect is nothing like how greenhouses work. Your paper towel is saturated when it won’t pick up any more spilled milk. In contrast greenhouse gases are saturated when there is no more milk left to pick up, as it were, but it is far more complex than this simple analogy suggests.

Happer is probably best known to our readers as a leading skeptical scientist. He co-founded the prestigious CO2 Coalition and recently served on the staff of the National Security Council, advising President Trump. But his career has been as a world class radiation physicist at Princeton. His numerous peer reviewed journal articles have collectively garnered over 12,000 citations by other researchers.

In this study Professors Happer and van Wijngaarden (H&W) have worked through the saturation physics in painstaking detail. Their preprint is titled “Dependence of Earth’s Thermal Radiation on Five Most Abundant Greenhouse Gases“. They have gone far beyond the work done to date on this complex problem.

To begin with, while the standard studies treat the absorption of radiation by greenhouse molecules using crude absorption bands of radiation energy, H&W analyze the millions of distinct energies, called spectral lines, which make up these bands. This line by line approach has been an emerging field of analysis, often giving dramatically new results.

Nor do they just look at absorption. Here is how Professor Happer put it to me:

“You would do our community a big favor by getting across two important points that few understand. Firstly: Thermal emission of greenhouse gases is just as important as absorption. Secondly: How the temperature of the atmosphere varies with altitude is as important as the concentration of greenhouse gases.”

So they looked hard, not just at absorption but also including emissions and atmospheric temperature variation. The work is exceedingly complex but the conclusions are dramatically clear.

Happer and van Wijngaarden’s central conclusion is this:

“For the most abundant greenhouse gases, H2O and CO2, the saturation effects are extreme, with per-molecule forcing powers suppressed by four orders of magnitude at standard concentrations...”

Their graphical conclusions are especially telling:

“Fig. 9 as well as Tables 2 and 4 show that at current concentrations, the forcings from all greenhouse gases are saturated. The saturations of the abundant greenhouse gases H2O and CO2 are so extreme that the per-molecule forcing is attenuated by four orders of magnitude…”

The other three greenhouse gases they analyzed are ozone, nitrous oxide and methane. These are also saturated but not extremely so like water vapor and carbon dioxide. They are also relatively minor in abundance compared to CO2, which in turn is small compared to H2O.

Clearly this is work that the climate science community needs to carefully consider. This may not be easy given that three major physics journals have refused to publish it. The reviews have been defensive and antagonistic, neither thoughtful nor helpful. Alarmism is in control of the journals, censoring contrary findings, hence the preprint version.

Undaunted, H&W are now extending their analysis to include clouds. Alarmist climate science gets dangerous global warming, not from the CO2 increase alone, but also using positive water vapor and cloud feedbacks. Given that carbon dioxide and water vapor are both extremely saturated, it is highly unlikely that cloud feedbacks alone can do much damage, but it requires careful analysis to know this for sure. Stay tuned.

In the meantime the present work needs to be front and center as we strive for rational climate science. Professors William Happer and William van Wijngaarden are to be congratulated for an elegant and timely breakthrough.

However, that has not been sufficient to meet the developmental goals and poverty is again on the rise. In recent years, poverty rose slightly in Africa for the first time in more than a decade, especially in countries like South Africa, Niger, and Uganda.

To make things more challenging, COVID-19 has had a negative effect on the GDP. The GDP of South Africa—the most economically developed nation in Africa—fell by 16.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the previous quarter.

Like any other developing country, the countries in Africa depend on a strong energy sector to propel their economy. But economic recovery in the midst of an existing situation of energy poverty is not easy. The overall electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa stands at just 52 percent, lower than many developing countries.

The Way Forward

Increase in commodity trade and development assistance from international agencies have been the major propellers of development in Africa. But that is not sustainable in the future.

What Africa needs is a strong energy sector that can spur a growth in its industrial sector and also increased agricultural productivity. While the improvement in agrarian sector will ensure stability in local food demand, a robust energy sector will act as the backbone of its future economy.

In a 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, Nigeria’s power minister Chinedu Ositadinma Nebo said, “I think Africa should be allowed to develop its coal potential. This is very critical. There are so many areas in Africa that will help to generate power for the over 60 percent of Africans that have no access to energy at all.”

His Tanzanian counterpart said, “We in Africa, we should not be in the discussion of whether we should use coal or not. In my country of Tanzania, we are going to use our natural resources because we have reserves which go beyond 5 billion tons.”

Both of them were right. Africa must be allowed to use the resources it has to pull itself out of energy poverty that has been keeping it way behind rest of the world.

But six years down the line, Africa finds itself in a very hostile world where there increasing difficulty in finding the capital to initiate and maintain their fossil fuel projects.

Anti-Coal Movement and The Sudden Investment Void

The World Bank Group that is financing coal projects is under pressure to discontinue its investment in fossil fuel projects. Only China remains as an active investor in major new fossil fuel projects in Africa.

Major international funders are beginning to withdraw funding for fossil fuel projects and enforce their pro-renewable policies. The African Development Bank announced in 2019 that it will no longer finance coal projects.

Norway excluded Africa’s biggest commodity firms from its $1 trillion wealth fund, in an effort to ensure that the fossil fuel sector does not receive Norwegian investment.

Private firms are also pulling out of fossil fuel projects in order to comply with the pro-renewable policy shift in Europe and Americas. One of the largest proposed coal power plant in East Africa is currently on hold, as the Lamu coal power plant is entangled in a legal battle.

In September this year, it faced further setbacks after the infrastructure provider General Electric chose to exit the project because of its new public policy of not aiding any new coal power projects.

Lessons from South Africa: Fossil Fuel is the Key

South Africa’s Eskom remains the largest energy producing company in the continent with about 50GW of installed capacity. Despite that, Eskom has faced significant challenges with its aging power distribution network, the growing demand-supply gap, and a host of other problems.

Further, Eskom’s dependence on renewables and hydroelectric power has its own set of problems. In March 2020, disruption from cyclone cut off power from hydroelectric plants in Mozambique.

Earlier this year, Eskom announced that load shedding (blackouts) will continue indefinitely. They stayed true to their word and residents across South Africa experienced scheduled and unscheduled blackouts throughout the year.

In contrast, increased dependence on fossil fuel-based power generating sources has proved to be fruitful. In August, resumption of power generation at idle units at coal-fired power stations helped Eskom suspend some of its planned power cuts.

Eskom is working tirelessly to fix the flaws in its aging coal fired plants in order to help them run at their full capacity. It has also decided to source electricity from independent power producers, which includes 3,000 MW of gas and 1,500 MW of coal.

Meanwhile, automation and digitization have helped mining operators in the country to enhance production. The proposed use of advanced wireless communication devices and machine control technology are examples of efforts aimed at increasing efficiency at mines.

Coal is also attracting traction in neighboring countries. In July, Zimbabwe’s largest thermal coal producer announced that it has clearance to produce 3 million tonnes of coal every year and would continue to do so for the next 48 years.

Besides fossil fuels, South Africa has also begun consulting nuclear power reactors suppliers for its ambitious 2,500MW Nuclear programme, which it believe will help address the huge demand-supply gap. The nation has already invested heavily (USD 1.2 billion) in reviving and prolonging the life of its only operational nuclear power plant in Cape Town.

Time to Liberate Africans from Energy Poverty

South Africa’s problems, despite being one of the most advanced country in Africa, is a wakeup call for the policy makers and leadership in other countries.

The opponents of fossil fuel projects have not provided solutions in alternate sources that could deliver the same type of stable electricity that coal projects would. Yet, they propose a ban on new fossil fuel projects in Africa, a move that can curtail developmental goals for many more decades.

According to Steve Chakerian from Northeast Group LLC, “Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic development remains tied to sustained growth in the power sector. The anticipated economic gains of the 2020s will depend in large part on bringing electricity to over 600 million people in the region that currently lack it.”

African leaders must rise up to the occasion, be open to investment help from China, and imitate the strong fossil fuel-based energy growth model of Asian countries like India and Japan. The very idea of a renewable energy-based grid must be put aside until the continent rises above energy poverty.

The new European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) law will impact all countries exporting to EU, especially those countries without carbon pricing mechanisms. Countries like India, China, Indonesia, Philippines, and even developed ones like Australia, Poland are likely to significantly affected by the CBAM.

Climate Justice and Carbon Border Taxes

The European Commission introduced the idea of CBAM in December 2019, as part of its EU Green Deal. The CBAM is likely to become a reality in 2021. But the EU’s large-scale climate-sanction through its CBAM will be treated with hostility in India, China and most developing countries.

Developing countries will view the CBAM as incompatible and inconsistent with the climate justice principle, a principle that is recognised by the parties of Paris Agreement, allowing developing countries to continue to use fossil fuels as well as receiving $100 billion p.a. in climate funds.

Big developing economies like India, Brazil, and China have always argued that the per capita emissions in the U.S. and EU are much higher than their own economies, and thus have rejected attempts by developed nations to introduce carbon border taxes in the past.

A CBAM at this juncture will cause more frictions among the nations and lead to greater objections to the commonly agreed goals under the Paris Climate Agreement.

Potential impact of CBAM and responses in India

India has called for a legal analysis of the deal to make sure that the proposed taxations from EU and U.S. do not impact its industries and economy.

Morgan Stanley’s review predicts that a carbon tax of $40 per ton of emissions will increase the cost of producing aluminum by more than 20% in China and India.

As a response to these taxes from EU and the U.S., the developing countries may introduce taxes of their own as a counter-measure to absorb the damage from the loss in export revenue and to signal their displeasure.

India and U.S. for example were involved in a tax-tussle during Trump’s term, where India reacted to U.S. taxations with counter-taxes on U.S. imports. EU imports a wide range of commercial and industrial products from India including chemicals, fabric, cement, and metals, and the CBAM will affect all these industries. The CBAM would impact most large industries in these sectors except for few Indian cement producers like Dalmia Bharat and Ambuja Cements as they’ve already taken measures to reduce carbon emissions.

Biden’s plans and energy use in developing countries

To make things more challenging, similar climate policies announced by the incoming Biden administration means that countries like India should also prepare for an US-influenced disruption in the fossil fuel sector.

Biden administration is likely to roll out its clean energy plan which has called for policies and actions that will aim to achieve a “carbon free power sector by 2035”.

The official page states that the policy will be “one that will put the United States on an irreversible path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.”

It remains to be seen how this transition policy will apply to the U.S. exports of oil, gas, and coal, especially for importers like India. The Trump administration highly favoured the production and export of oil, and it is still unclear if it will be the same during Biden’s administration.

The U.S. petroleum exports doubled between 2015 and 2019. Among its biggest customers are developing countries like India, Brazil, and Mexico. All these countries could see a disruption in oil imports under Biden administration.

Likewise, the US natural gas exports were on an increase in the past three years. Among the developing countries, Mexico, India and Chile were the biggest importers of US Liquid natural gas in 2019.

India particularly has been heavily reliant on US oil and gas. India’s LNG imports from U.S. skyrocketed from around 21,000 million cubic feet in 2017 to around 92,000 million cubic feet in 2019.

A Biden administration constraint on US oil and gas production would put the Indian oil and gas sector in trouble, especially when they have begun to move away from their traditional suppliers in Middle East like Iran.

But it is quite uncertain as to how fossil fuel exports or the trade relationships will evolve in the next few years. India, for example, has expressed its interest in resuming oil imports from Venezuela and Iran, as it believes that a Biden administration would ease the sanctions that currently restrict oil exports from these countries to India.

The EU meanwhile struck a major trade deal with Beijing during the final days of 2020 despite all the rhetoric surrounding CBAM and reservations expressed by Biden’s energy team. It will give European companies greater access to Chinese markets.

EU’s desire to make financial gains through a trade deal with China, despite the latter’s active involvement in the growth of fossil fuel market in Asia and Africa, shows the EU’s hypocrisy when it comes to walking the talk on CO2 emissions. It makes their CBAM hypocritical and selective policy that has turned a blind eye to the largest consumer of fossil fuels in the world.

Given the complexity of the fossil fuel trade relationships, the West’s defiant stand to reduce fossil fuel consumption, and EU’s surprising decision to make a significant trade deal with the biggest fossil fuel consumer China, it is difficult to predict the impact of CBAM and the Clean Energy plan on the overall trade relationships.

The CBAM will likely cause industry-level adjustments in major fossil fuel countries like India, which may eventually lead to compromised growth and prolongation of the deadlines to achieve developmental targets. It will eventually impact the consumers and the economy which is already reeling under the impact of COVID-19 lockdown.

Carbon imperialism, geopolitical tensions,

and trade relationships

Besides the direct energy impact and subsequent disruption to the economy, EU and Biden’s carbon tax moves may also pave way for geopolitical tensions. India, for example, is a crucial ally for the U.S. in Asia, and the former may view these carbon taxes as a disruptive element in its relationship with the West.

The CBAM and similar taxes from the Biden administration may alienate developing countries like India and make them increase their trade relationships with global fossil fuel giants like China. In fact, China is already the biggest fossil fuel enabler, building coal plants in Africa and Asia. Despite the border issues, India may look at China as a more favourable trade partner, should the carbon taxes turn out to be disruptive. China is India’s second biggest export market, the US being the number one. But if carbon taxes kick in, things may change. Even the border scuffle in 2020 did not deter Indian exports to China which went up by 16%.

India has always been against the imposition of tough carbon laws. In 2017, the Chief Economic Advisor to the India’s Prime Minister, Arvind Subramaniam, slammed the Western powers for their restrictive energy policies that they were trying to impose on developing countries like India. He called it a form of “Green Imperialism”, where the Western powers like the U.S. and the EU were trying to exert economic control over the country by trying to restrict fossil fuel use which has been acting as India’s economic lifeline.

With the advent of the CBAM, the fears expressed by India’s former economic advisor is becoming a reality. But India in all likelihood will not allow the CBAM to burden its economy. Speaking at an event this week, India’s Home Minister Amit Shah said, “the coal sector will be the largest contributor to India’s ambition of being a $5 trillion economy.” He added that State run and private firms will invest around Rs 4 trillion in India’s coal sector.

The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, with 30 named storms, is going down in the record books as having the most named storms of any season on record. But are we comparing apples and apples—or apples and oranges?

Some people blame the recent increase in named storms—tropical storms and hurricanes—on global warming, and infer that we must stop spewing CO2 into the atmosphere to curb the warming and so prevent the increase in storms and the damage they cause.

But the raw data for hurricane history is contaminated by changes in observing tools, in our understanding, and in the philosophy of whether a storm should be named. What explains the increase in named storms? Was it an abnormal meteorological event, or are there other explanations? To answer this requires some discussion of the origin of Atlantic storms.

How Do Atlantic Storms Begin?

One of the requirements for a tropical storm is a pre-existing weather disturbance that is producing thunderstorms. In the Atlantic during the summer, there are four categories of pre-existing weather disturbances. Two have their origin in the deep tropics, and two mainly in subtropical latitudes.

The most common tropical disturbances are African systems. Every 3 to 5 days, a new disturbance emerges from Africa. Trade winds carry these westward across the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, and sometimes all the way to the Pacific. Every summer we track around 50, and about 10% develop into named storms.

A second category of tropical disturbances is found along the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITC)—a boundary where winds from the northern hemisphere clash with winds from the southern hemisphere.

The developmental process for weather disturbances found in the deep tropics is very straightforward. They generate thunderstorms that heat the atmosphere, and as the hot air rises it is replaced by air spiraling at the surface, producing a tropical storm. We can call this “tropical energy.”

The development process for pre-existing weather disturbances that originate in the subtropical latitudes (Central and North Atlantic) is far more complex. In this case the initial energy driving the disturbance is baroclinic—a term denoting winds that are generated when cold air moves under warm air. All winter storms are driven by this type of energy.

Over the Atlantic during the summer, two types of baroclinic systems operate to produce tropical storms. One occurs mainly during the spring and fall, when a low-pressure system develops along a dissipating cold front that has moved offshore from the U.S. mainland and stalls.

A second type occurs in the upper part of the atmosphere (25,000 ft. and higher). Occasionally, one of these “upper lows” strengthens and spins downward to the surface and may generate a named storm.

Some baroclinic disturbances can convert into tropical storms, and the process by which they do so is complicated. Consider the following scenario. In late May a cold front moves off the mid-Atlantic coast and stalls. A disturbance develops along the front and strengthens. Winds reach 45 mph. The initial energy is all baroclinic. However, thunderstorms generated by the disturbance warm the atmosphere, and now the system is being driven by both baroclinic and tropical energy.

Should the system be named a “tropical storm”? Not unless the tropical energy completely dominates the baroclinic energy. Occasionally this does occur, and the system morphs into a tropical storm.

Once they decide to name the storm, forecasters face another problem. As the storm moves toward the north Atlantic, thunderstorms decrease because of colder water, and cold air is drawn

into the circulation. The winds have not decreased, but baroclinic energy again dominates, and the system is unnamed as it transforms into a post-tropical remnant storm.

To Name or Not to Name? That Is the Question

The decision to name or unname this type of systems is very subjective, since we do not have an objective way to measure the contribution of each energy source. That is why forecasters in the past have been reluctant to name baroclinic-initiated storms.

Forecasters were faced with this decision four times in 2020, and each time they chose to name the system: Dolly, Edward, Kyle, and Omar. All four started out as baroclinic disturbances along dissipating cold fronts and then morphed into tropical storms under the influence of heat from thunderstorms. But following a very short tropical life of less than 24 to 36 hours, re-examination revealed that baroclinic energy once again dominated, and they were reclassified as post-tropical remnant lows (winter-type storms). This year we even named a baroclinic storm approaching Europe—Alpha was named a few hours before making landfall in Portugal.

Would these storms have received a name 30 or 40 years ago? Probably not, and data show this to be true.

The historical record of baroclinic-initiated tropical storms in the subtropical Atlantic north of latitude 25N for the past 75 years also reveals a recent trend to name more storms of this type. If we divide the 75 years into three 25-year periods, the first (1946–1970) is pre-satellite. Satellite pictures did not become available to operational forecasters until the late 1960s. This left us unable to observe storms in vast stretches of the Atlantic. During this time, under one storm per year (0.7/yr.) could be traced back to a baroclinic origin.

Satellite pictures were available during the second 25-year period (1971–1995), allowing us, for the first time, to detect storms in those vast stretches, which explains why there was a slight increase in the number of baroclinic systems, to 1.7 per year.

A big surprise occurred in the years 1996–2020, when there was an unexpected jump to 4 per year. A big part of the increase took place during the last decade, when the number increased to 5 per year.

Another study confirms this trend. During the 1970s and 1980s, over 50% of all named storms in the Atlantic were initiated by African systems. Another 10–15% were generated by disturbances on the ITC. It is not surprising to find that almost 70% of all named storms in the Atlantic trace their origin to weather disturbances whose origin was in the deep tropics. Fewer than 30% of Atlantic named storms originated as baroclinic systems (~15% by stalled cold fronts, and ~15% by upper–level lows).

Similar statistics for the last decade (2011–2020) show a significant increase in the number of baroclinic systems being named. Currently, 45% of named storms are caused by baroclinic systems, while the other 55% come from tropical disturbances.

The numbers for 2020 confirm the trend to name baroclinic disturbances. Thirteen of the 30 storms had a baroclinic origin, and 10 of those occurred in the subtropical Atlantic.

The number of named storms generated by tropical disturbances has not decreased, but there has been a significant increase in the number of named storms generated by baroclinic disturbances. Has there been a change in the philosophy of naming baroclinic-driven, winter-like storms that occur in the summer? If so, does this contaminate the historical record of Atlantic hurricanes, making more the numbers for the last 25 years not directly comparable with the numbers for the previous 50?

Without question satellites account for some of the increase in the number of detected and named tropical storms. One recent study examined the number of tropical storms that formed over the eastern Atlantic and never moved westward beyond longitude 50W. In pre-satellite years (1918–1968), we tracked an average of 1 storm every 2 years. During the satellite period (1969–2019), we tracked 2 to 3 per year—a 4- to 6-fold increase. This year 4 storms—Rene, Vicky, Wilfred, and Theta—fall into this category.

Another factor accounting for the increase in named storms was a subtle change in the requirements for naming a storm. Airplanes are used to determine the strength of a storm. They measure the winds at flight level and drop an instrument in the eye to determine the central pressure. Since there is a direct relationship between wind and pressure, if you know one you can determine the other.

When investigating a weather disturbance, it is not uncommon for the plane to encounter an area of strong winds associated with a band of thunderstorms. Should the system be named? What does the pressure show? If the pressure is not low enough to justify the winds, in the past the system was not named until the pressure responded. Not so today. The current philosophy is to use the observed winds to name a storm regardless of the pressure. The result is a few more named storms, and an increasing number of storms that have a lifetime of less than 24 to 36 hours. This year Bertha was named based on wind alone an hour and a half before making landfall in South Carolina. Could this emphasis on winds be the reason why there are more baroclinic-generated named storms in the North Atlantic?

Another unique feature of the 2020 hurricane season was that 3 hurricanes hit Louisiana. Some media reported that that had never happened before. But Florida was hit by four hurricanes in 2005. And the most active hurricane season as far as landfalls was 1886, when seven hurricanes hit the Gulf coast. Three were in northwest Florida and four in Texas, and two of those in Texas were major (Category 3 or higher). The last major hurricane to hit Texas in October struck in 1886 and destroyed what was left of Indianola, a once thriving seaport of the south shore of Matagorda Bay.

Maybe 2020 Wasn’t So Strange After All

In conclusion, the hurricane season in 2020 was very active, but was it record breaking?

Prior to the 29 named storms recorded in 2005 and 30 in 2020, 1933 held the record for the most in any one year with 21. It is revealing to take a close look at the 1933 hurricane season.

The deep tropics were on fire. Of the 21 storms, 17 were initiated by numerous African systems along with a few ITC disturbances. Only one baroclinic disturbance developed in the Gulf, and another three in the southwest Caribbean. No storms were tracked that developed from baroclinic disturbances in the subtropical Atlantic, and none were recorded in the Eastern Atlantic. Were there were no storms in these two areas in 1933? We do not know, because tools necessary to track storms in the eastern and northern Atlantic didn’t exist yet.

What we do know is that in 2020, with satellites and recon planes, 10 baroclinic storms developed in the subtropical Atlantic, of which 2 were east of 50W longitude. These 2, combined with 3 other African systems that weakened, make 5 in the Eastern Atlantic. A fair comparison of the 1933 hurricane season with 2020 would be to reduce the number of storms in 2020 by around 10. If we do that, 1933 is still one of the most active hurricane summers in modern times.

With all of the uncertainties in the raw data, the only credible indicator of any trend in Atlantic hurricane activity is to look at the major hurricanes (Categories 3–5) making landfall in mainland USA. A tropical storm or even a weak hurricane might have hit a sparsely populated region in the 1800s or the early 1900s and gone undetected. In contrast, all major hurricanes with winds in excess of 110 mph crossing the U.S. coastline in the last 175 years have probably been recorded.

Contrary to the claim that global warming is causing more named storms, over the past several decades the number of major hurricanes hitting the U.S. coastline has fallen. There were none for twelve years (2005–2017). This was the longest period on record without a major hurricane. On average, one major hurricane crosses the U.S. border every two years.

In contrast to mainstream media claims, there has been no increase in Atlantic hurricane activity in recent decades. As a matter of fact, world-wide there has been a 5–10% decrease in hurricane-type storms in the last 50 years.

Two-thirds of India’s 1.3 billion people depend on farming. When they learn that I do research in environmental sciences, the first question they ask is, “How is climate change going to impact agriculture in India?”

Unpredictable Monsoon

The answer is not clear. Indian rainfall seasons have shown no specific trend over the past hundred years, and it is extremely difficult to predict the impact of warming or cooling.

The farmers here—like those in most other agrarian countries—understand seasonal changes and their impacts on their crops and earnings.

However, even the most experienced farmer is quite lost when it comes to predicting the yearly rainfall levels as the tropical monsoon system—which provides most of the water for agriculture in India—is highly unpredictable.

As a result, farmers in India face challenging times each year, because their crops are highly sensitive to annual rainfall, and no one can predict what it will be.

Farmer Protest, Nothing in Comparison to Rainfall Anxieties

In the last ten days, farmers in India have been in the news for a different reason. News agencies across the globe broadcast the Indian Farmer Protests at New Delhi. A fraction of farmers are protesting new laws, despite the laws’ being beneficial to them.

Last week, on a 250-mile ride through an agricultural hotspot, I encountered one such protest. There could have been many others, but this one was small compared to those in India’s capital, which have been televised globally.

Most of the farmers, especially those in the southern part of the country, were not worried as much about the new laws as about how much rainfall would come this year.

Abundant Rains and Resilient Agricultural Sector

In fact, many are happy this year, because most of the reservoirs and water bodies that serve their fields have received plenty of rainfall this year. In my home state of Tamil Nadu, the dams are full enough to avoid a drought in the next summer. The neighboring states have received normal to excess rainfall, too. Overall, India has had a good rainfall year.

Still, there is no guarantee that next year will be the same. But this is because of the unpredictable nature of Indian monsoon, not because of any increase in global average temperature.

Despite the uncertainties of annual rainfall, the Indian farming sector has grown increasingly successful. The country has registered record crop outputs each of the past three years. With the rapid deployment of agricultural technology and the likely approval of biotech crop varieties, the yields are likely to continue to increase.

The agricultural sector here in India may be encountering a few problems, but climate change is not one of them."
https://cornwallalliance.org/2020/12/gm-crops-more-important-to-africas-food-security-than-ever/,GM Crops: More Important to Africa’s Food Security Than Ever,Vijay Jayaraj,2020-12-16 17:08:27+00:00,,"The economic situation in Africa has improved a lot since the 1990s. Yet, rampant poverty and food insecurity still impact millions of lives there.

Currently, there is a huge demand/supply gap in the agricultural sector. At least three hundred million are malnourished.

The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization defines food security as “a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.”

Africa’s agricultural sector needs to be strengthened to meet the demand for quality food. In 2017, Africa spent $64.5 billion importing food, but importing food is not sustainable in the long run.

World Food Prize Laureate Dr. Akinwumi Adesina says, “It is unacceptable for Africa to import food. Why? Because the continent holds 65 percent of the world’s uncultivated arable land. Properly used, even a small part of that land could provide sufficient food for all Africans and even for export.”

While other countries have moved way ahead in food production, Africa has lagged behind. Agricultural productivity in Africa has remained stagnant for the last 40 years. That must not continue.

Norman Borlaug — father of the Green Revolution — had a special passion to uplift the poor in Africa. Reports recall that “his last words before his death concerned the plight of African farmers, whose lives he had been devoted to improving for almost 30 years.”

The global Green Revolution — spurred by Borlaug’s gene-edited crop varieties — began in the 1960s and enabled countries to produce record outputs. The cost of cereal grains declined by 30% during the 1980s.

The heart of this revolution was carefully cross-bred crop varieties. They were more robust to varied and changing climatic conditions, higher yielding, and more resistant to disease and pests. All of these ingredients made the Green Revolution a turning point in global agricultural history.

With the advancement of genetic technology, scientists now can achieve even greater improvements with higher precision in less time. Many Genetically Modified (GM) crops are scientifically tested, approved by the world’s top medical agencies, and declared safe by hundreds of Nobel Prize-winning scientists.

More than 100 independent, U.S., European, and international scientific societies have approved GM crops for their safety and recognize that they do not pose risk to the environment or human health.

In contrast, they are more beneficial than the non-GM variants. According to such scientists, the benefits of GM crops include increased yield, improved quality, and adaptability to specific abiotic and biotic stresses such as drought, pests, and disease, among others.

A study that assessed the environmental effects of GM crops globally found that GM crop use reduced pesticide spraying by 352 million kilograms between 1996 and 2008.

GM variants of rice, maize, wheat, cotton, canola, potatoes, aubergines (eggplant), squash, soya beans, papaya, and sugar beets have already been approved and commercially cultivated in more than 185 million hectares across the globe. GM crops constitute more than 75% of the globally produced soya bean.

In Africa, a continent where food security needs more attention than any other place, GM crops are yet to penetrate the agricultural scene.

Currently, only three countries in Africa — South Africa, Sudan, and Burkina Faso — have adopted GM crops on a large scale. GM crops account for around 2.3 million hectares of agriculture in South Africa, consisting of GM cotton, maize, and soya beans.

Other countries, like Kenya, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Tanzania, Malawi, Uganda, Mozambique, and Nigeria, are in the process of adopting GM crops in their commercial sectors.

A number of countries approved GM crops in 2020. Despite a ban on GM crops since 2011, Kenya approved the cultivation of GM cotton. Nigeria, a key economy in West Africa, approved GM variants of both cotton and cowpea.

GM crop introduction in the past has had tremendous benefits in the continent. The disease-resistant cassava plants helped farmers overcome the Cassava Mosaic Virus, resulting in higher yields. Likewise, GM soya bean farming has been highly beneficial to the farmers in South Africa.

But genetically modified crops are yet to penetrate deep into the African agricultural sector due to opposition from anti-GMO lobbies and radical environmentalists.

If Africa wants to get serious about its food security, it must approve GM crops and stay clear of the anti-GM movement that has robbed billions of their rightful access to GM crops — crops that are economically and socially valuable. A strong political will to embrace GM crops will ensure that Africans will be better fed in the future.

According to many critics, Western billionaires do not make the best farmers. Perhaps it is their inability (or unwillingness) to downsize grandiose plans from a Western-style agribusiness model to merely helping millions of subsistence farmers that dot the African landscape succeed in providing nutritious diets for their families and communities.

That’s the conclusion of a major report from Germany entitled False Promises: The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the billion-dollar endeavor led by the Bill and Melinda Gates and Rockefeller Foundations. Project coordinators Lena Bassermann and Jan Urhahn credit Timothy A. Wise, Senior Research Fellow at Tuft University’s Global Development and Environment Institute, for the research that supported many of their conclusions.

Indian development economist Jayati Ghosh praised the False Promises report in a scathing condemnation of the Green Revolution published in October. Ghosh, citing a July UN Food and Agricultural Organization report that showed a 10 percent increase in global hunger since 2014, argued that the global food system was already badly broken before the 2020 COVID pandemic.

Bassermann and Urhahn asserted that the AGRA model of input-intensive agriculture has failed to reach large numbers of small-scale food producers effectively. They urged governments to abandon political and financial support for AGRA and instead begin funding programs that help small-scale producers.

Coauthor Jan Urhahn, writing in the far-left Jacobin magazine, said that Africans should eschew the Green Revolution and practice “agroecology,” which makes conscious use of nature and natural processes to promote the kinds of soil-building practices that they argue become impossible when Green Revolution technologies are used.

Since its founding in 2006, AGRA has invested in programs that support the use of high-yielding commercial seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and chemical pesticides (all of which must be purchased by farmers) and the use of monocropping to increase yields per acre. AGRA issued grants of more than $500 million to promote this vision of a “modernized” African agriculture.

As Malaysian economist Jomo Kwame Sundaram explained, AGRA had promised that countries using their methods would double productivity and incomes for 30 million small-scale farming households and cut food insecurity in half by 2020. To entice farmers to literally “buy” into the program, at least ten African governments matched the AGRA grants with sizable outlays via “Form of Input Subsidy Programs” (FISPs).

These FISP grants helped farmers pay for hybrid seeds and synthetic fertilizers – and monocropping – that AGRA promotes. But False Promises condemns AGRA for allowing some 30,000 “agro-preneurs” to decide what crops farmers should grow and thus endangering the rights of small-scale food producers to self-determination and food sovereignty.

False Promises further claims that AGRA has yet to present reliable estimates of the number of small-scale food producer households reached, improvements in their yields, household net incomes or food security, or its progress in achieving its own ambitious goals. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they claim, has been equally silent. This lack of accountability and oversight, they contended, is ASTOUNDING for a program that for so long has driven Africa’s agricultural development policies.

AGRA President Agnes Kalibata, a principal target of AGRA critics, in a recent article painted a very different picture. Kalibata, a former minister of agriculture in Rwanda, sounded like her critics in asserting that, “Most of the big mistakes in development have happened when external actors have foisted their ideas and ideologies on the continent.”

African farmers, she continued, “deserve the same opportunities enjoyed by farmers in Europe and North America. They do not want to be stuck with 40-year-old seed varieties,” and boasted of 90 percent adoption rates for new seeds in Nigeria and Burkina Faso. AGRA, she noted, has helped establish over 110 African seed companies that provide 700,000 metric tons of seeds to 20 million out of Africa’s 45 million farmers.

But she had no answers for the lack of progress other than to state that, “Inclusive agriculture transformation is not a quick fix,” and to seek another $25 to $35 billion a year of investments to transform African agriculture into the AGRA model.

The Gates-Rockefeller team sought through AGRA to inject modern agribusiness practices into Africa that had previously been eschewed by Western decision makers. The problem is that their methods were not well suited to ensure that their promises would be kept – and, perhaps, that they promised too much too soon. Perhaps they failed to plan for both agribusiness and small-scale family farming. Perhaps, though, they are learning from their mistakes.

The Western billionaires who founded AGRA and set its course would have done well to learn from history. In 2009, Pater Hazell commemorated the passing of Green Revolution architect and Nobel Prize winner Norman Borlaug in an article examining how Borlaug’s vision turned Asian farming economies around.

Hazell defended the Green Revolution against claims that indigenous technologies in combination with “good practices” would have done a better job of feeding Asia (just as False Promises says would be better for Africa). He asserted that in the early 1960s famine was looming across much of Asia in the early 1960s and that Asian farmers were ill-equipped to meet that challenge.

The introduction of Borlaug’s high-yield wheat and rice, however, led to a doubling of cereal production from 1970 to 1995. Thus, despite a 60 percent increase in population, cereal and calorie availability per person increased by 30 percent as wheat and rice prices dropped. Hazell also said that most small farms successfully adopted Green Revolution technologies, though at a slower pace than larger scale producers.

But Hazell was also quick to point out weaknesses in the Asian approach that could well be applied to Africa today. In Asia, equitable distribution of land, together with government support of small-scale operations, was essential to small farmer gains, as inequalities worsened in regions where this support did not exist. The focus on monoculture led to the loss of many traditional plant varieties, and in some places poor irrigation and drainage practices ruined prime farmland.

African nations, Hazell admitted, were facing other obstacles to rapid Green Revolution success, notably the lack of rural infrastructure (highways, electric grids) that saddle African farmers with high costs for transportation and marketing, as well as for seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides. Thus, Hazell concluded, Africa must not merely copy the Asian model and shift to high-input, high-output farming. The Gates-Rockefeller team, according to False Promises, did not heed Hazell’s warning, and thereby betrayed small farmers in their push toward an agribusiness model.

Despite the widespread catcalls to ditch the entire AGRA initiative, there is still a decade for African nations to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals for agriculture. Kalibata has promised an African-centered approach to the Green Revolution, one that focuses on the farmer while scaling up inputs to reach maximum yields.

Fifty years ago, many feared that the American family farm would soon be history as a result of growing agribusiness consolidation. Today, family farms (including wineries), augmented by a growing farmers’ market subculture, are in many places thriving alongside agribusiness giants. It is possible to implement an agriculture program that provides sufficient resources for both large-scale agrobusinesses and small-scale, diversified family farms. It is the either-or approach that endangers Africa’s future.

https://cornwallalliance.org/2020/10/a-plea-to-my-evangelical-friends-for-biden/,A Plea to My Evangelical Friends for Biden,Peter JonesMichael L O'NeillMeganToombs,2020-10-23 16:47:40+00:00,,"October 20, 2020 by Dr. Peter Jones

How should genuine Christians vote in the up-coming presidential election? Recently a group called “pro-life evangelicals for Biden” sought to answer that question. The group includes many prominent evangelical leaders whom I respect who believe “that a biblically shaped commitment to the sanctity of human life compels us to a consistent ethic of life that affirms the sanctity of human life from beginning to end.”[1] Essentially in using the formulation, “from beginning to end,” they mean that (apart from abortion, which they oppose), the socialist state in Biden’s program is “pro-life,” supported by the Bible, whereas Trump’s system kills.

I will respond to four points held by this group and conclude with a theological critique of the whole. They state that…

1. Lack of state health care kills.

The Biden evangelicals argue that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, which Trump desires to eliminate, is a “sanctity of life issue.”

Response:

Total state health care sounds biblical because it wants to reach everyone and understands the impossible situation of some who have long-term disease or extraordinarily expensive medications. I’m sure there are problems in our current healthcare system that need to be addressed. It is not clear, however, that a more socialist approach to healthcare will be any more effective or fair than the present system. Some find that the Affordable Care Act is not so affordable and does not meet their needs.[2] We can certainly analyze healthcare systems such as the National Health Service in the UK, which gives everyone medical coverage, and may have some benefits, but can we call it “biblical”? If so, it may have some verses missing. Like our spotty postal service (which recently delivered to my home a letter postmarked in 1994!), many state systems can be impersonal and inefficient, with waiting periods of months or years for elective interventions like knee and hip surgery. In such cases, citizens may pay high fees to be treated through “private” medicine, which, in the end, becomes a different sort of privileged medicine. Unfortunately, Trump has not, to my knowledge, provided any detailed healthcare proposal, though he has promised that his plan would cover patients with pre-existing conditions.

2. Poverty kills.

Biden evangelicals argue that people die of poverty and that providing “a minimum wage that lifts workers out of poverty” is pro-life and biblical.

Response:

Throughout the Scriptures, Christians are enjoined to show compassion for the poor. It is true that poverty increases mortality rates due to increased homelessness, limited healthcare, poor diet, inadequate housing, dangerous neighborhoods, and limited access to heating and air conditioning. The socialist plan, however, while purporting to lift people out of poverty, may actually lock people in a poverty cycle of welfare, laziness and entitlement. Both Christians and non-Christians give generously to help, but the question is how best to help them. Trump has done much to lift people out of poverty by providing jobs (pre-Pandemic). Hand-outs have their place, but they rarely lift people out of poverty. As the saying goes, it is better to teach people how to fish rather than providing free fish for all. Trump’s approach respects the creative image of God in people and begins to solve the endemic problem of poverty. This approach has biblical support: “Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share with those in need” (Eph. 4:28). The Apostle Paul created a rule in the church: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat” (2 Thess. 3:10). So job creation, though not the only tool, is a powerful one in lifting people from poverty.

3. Climate change kills.

The group states: “Climate change already kills untold thousands and will soon kill tens of millions unless we change.”

Response:

Climate change is another subject on which well-meaning Christians (and scientists!) disagree. It is important to examine the claims on which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others surrounding Biden have created plans such as the Green New Deal to rescue our world from ecological disaster. How do we prove or disprove the claim that “untold thousands” have been killed by climate change? Not all intelligent scientists accept the tenets of their more radical colleagues.[3] The Christian Post observes:“Noted environmentalists Bjorn Lomborg (who won the Nobel Peace Prize) and Michael Shellenberger (founder and president of Environmental Progress), claim that climate alarmism has done more harm than good. In fact, Shellenberger argues that some global warming may significantly reduce the world’s hunger problem by turning places like Greenland into a productive food-producing region.”[4]

Defining climate change science as a “pro-life” issue and the lack of it as a killer is not convincing. Even the official United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that if we do nothing to slow global warming, the world’s poorest nations, thanks to the recent availability of electricity and fossil fuels, will be many times wealthier by 2100. If fossil fuels and easy access to electricity are removed from poor nations, they are more susceptible to disease and death than they would be from climate change.[5] The Green New Deal endorsed by Biden promises to put an end to fossil fuels around the world, which would greatly add to the impoverishment of all peoples.

Moreover, climate changes constantly. In the 1970s, we were fearing another ice age. Human beings have adapted to climates as different as those found in deserts or the Arctic Circle. Even those most serious about affecting our climate favorably, estimate that the goal of avoiding a 3 degree rise in the earth’s temperature will not occur before AD 2100. By that time, we will all be “killed” by old age. Life itself is a killer. Here the verb to “kill” is misused. Comparing what some might define as climate malfeasance with slicing up a baby in the womb is a misuse of moral reasoning that seems to function as a way to ease our conscience. The satirical Babylon Bee calls this group “Evangelical worshipers of Moloch”![6] There is truth in the satire, however. Moloch was a pagan god to whom worshipers sacrificed their children, a practice that Israel not only failed to wipe out but even practiced (including its kings).

4. Racism kills.

The ideological commitment of my evangelical friends is evident when they call racism “a killer.” They state: “African-Americans are several times more likely than white Americans to be killed by the police.”

Response:

This claim that white police are systematically accomplishing black genocide has been statistically disproven, but if news outlets quote Black Lives Matter often enough, the populace doesn’t hear those statistics. Even the mistreatment of George Floyd was done by one black, one Asian and two white officers. The Marxists running Black Lives Matter follow their ideological forefathers in a holistic racist attack on America.[7] Evangelicals for Biden argues that Trump stokes racism rather than uniting the country to struggle against it. But such an accusation seems quite subjective. Biden has made many anti-black statements in his long career and, by their socialism, the Democrats have, unwittingly, broken up and impoverished the black family.[8] At the same time, Trump has improved the conditions of the black community, as a growing number of blacks testify.[9] An unprecedented 24% of black men seek to escape the Democratic plantation and say they will vote for Trump.[10] Since taking office, Trump has funded historically black universities, raised the median wealth for black families by 33 percent, brought about criminal justice reform, and created “Opportunity Zones” for economic development in low income districts. Also, as the most pro-life modern president, he has sought to discourage abortion in the black community. Trump recently said in a public speech: “Every child is made in the image of God with a sacred right to life. This is our moral duty.”[11] “Biblical Biden” has never said this. Thanks to Roe v. Wade, in the last 47 years 19 million black babies have been aborted. This is the killer. And in the name of freedom, the Biden/Harris team will certainly add to this number. So who is racist?

My pro-life, pro-Biden friends fail to make a convincing case for the biblical character of Biden socialism. Can we bear the effect on our conscience if we facilitate the scandalous practice of infanticide?

A Theological Critique

I know and respect many of the evangelical scholars who have put out this statement. It is hard for me to suggest that these deep-thinking scholars and leaders naively fail theologically. But I do believe they fail to understand the godless ideology that drives Biden’s progressivism. Behind Biden, who is perhaps as naïve as Trump, is not the Bible but the most radical view of American culture that any party has put forth since the inception of the nation. Democratic progressivism is out of control in some of our cities. The debate between Republicans and Democrats is no longer about tweaking our democratic republic in economics or international relations. The Left now proposes a Sanders Socialist Marxism that will leave our borders uncontrolled, replace law and order [defund the police] with mob rule, pass the Equality Act imposing the LGBTQ agenda on everyone, promote “critical race theory,” reject nature and nature’s God, promote transgenderism (even in young children) and pack the Supreme Court with radical lawyers, who will destroy the carefully poised structure of American democracy. This governmental and cultural makeover is funded and promoted by billionaire and anti-American George Soros[12] and the hi-tech monopolies of Silicon Valley, like Twitter and Facebook. Ominously, these monopolies threaten freedom of the press and freedom of opinion, as evidenced by the recent suppression of a newspaper article proving the vast financial corruption of Joe and Hunter Biden.

Where this will go I do not know, but I have little faith in an amoral progressivism that no longer believes that liberty comes from God. In this system, the end justifies the means, and if the end is power then power also becomes the means to achieving power. This election is an attempt at a cultural revolution. If Biden wins, we will be forced to live in a society made up of endless irreconcilable identity groups whose rule depends upon pure power. The power grab will define America’s political past as evil, impose a cancel culture package that will undo the created structures of family and sexuality, protection of the unborn, the practice of Christian religion, everyday fair play based on the Constitution, and free speech. It should be clear that the accusation of systemic racism now coursing through the veins of many of our institutions and corporations, is actually a call for the overthrow of the so-called corrupt American system and the way of life that made America the most civilized nation in human history. Newt Gingrich, speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999 calls this cultural moment the end of civilization as we have known it. Others believe it is an election comparable to that of 1860, when Lincoln fought to hold the states together as a slave-free nation. Evangelicals for Biden, I beg you to reconsider.

Much of the opposition to Trump is to his instinctive, often naïve opposition to the radical program that seeks to describe the nature of America’s past and present as irredeemably evil. Many of us are offended by his populist/crude language, but then, he is, after all, a NY businessman. But we must guard against allowing a dislike of his style to become a form of superficial self-righteousness. Like every past president, Trump is a sinner. So is Biden, whose financial corruption is unfolding daily. We cannot vote based on personal likes or dislikes. We must vote on policies, which are passed into law and remain. Should our dislike of Trump’s superficial idiosyncrasies lead us to vote for a party that vehemently endorses no-limit abortion? Should Trump’s bombastic and somewhat megalomaniacal style cause us to invite into the halls of the White House socialistic progressive policies from which we may never recover?

My evangelical friends for Biden conclude: “For these reasons, we believe that on balance, Joe Biden’s policies are more consistent with the biblically shaped ethic of life than those of Donald Trump.” Will we cheer on a progressive movement that dresses itself in Christian garb, yet builds a self-defined, anti-theistic, anti-Creator politico-religion?

In thinking of the future of our children and grandchildren, we must ask if a political movement that integrates into its system without difficulty the wholesale slaughter of babies can be represented as a “biblically-shaped ethic.” Abortion is not an efficient solution to unwanted pregnancy. This ethic is shaped by the rejection of God the Creator. Whenever and wherever such policies have been systemically employed, those in power quickly rid society of the Bible, biblical Christians, and the Twoist worship of “the Creator who is blessed forever” (Romans 1:25) requiring, rather, that all bow in Oneist worship to nature and to the pagan god, Moloch whose heated bronze body was a furnace for the sacrificing of children.

Friends, is Biden’s worldview worth your evangelical vote?

Calvin BeisnerRandy KielPhilip J. Brooks,2020-10-14 18:22:52+00:00,,"In my years as a seminary professor of ethics, I saw few things more sinister and devious than the seemingly innocuous statement, “a biblically shaped commitment to the sanctity of human life compels us to a consistent ethic of life that affirms the sanctity of human life from beginning to end.” That’s not because life isn’t sacred from beginning to end, but because those who use it do so consistently to hide a serious ethical confusion.

Recently a group calling itself “Pro-Life Evangelicals for Biden,” spearheaded by long-time leaders of the evangelical Left Ronald Sider and Richard Mouw, released a statement that begins,

“As Pro-life evangelicals, we disagree with Vice President Biden and the Democratic platform on the issue of abortion. But we believe a Biblically shaped commitment to the sanctity of human life compels us to a consistent ethic of life that affirms the sanctity of human life from beginning to end.”

It continues,

“Poverty kills millions every year. So does lack of healthcare and smoking. Racism kills. Unless we quickly make major changes, devastating climate change will kill tens of millions. Poverty, lack of accessible health care services, smoking, racism and climate change are all pro-life issues.”

What many people won’t recognize is that this statement twists the meaning of “pro-life.”

As I demonstrated in my booklet “How Does the Creation Care Movement Threaten the Pro-Life Movement,” this use of the term “pro-life” runs directly contrary to standard dictionary definitions, all which define “pro-life” as opposition to abortion—not opposition to hunger, not opposition to poverty, not opposition to practices that lead to poor health—opposition to abortion.

Far worse, the new statement demonstrates serious ethical failures: the failure to distinguish between intentional and accidental harm, and the failure to distinguish between life and death, on the one hand, and better and worse health, on the other.

By so doing, it obscures the meaning of “pro-life” and undermines the pro-life movement. In abortion, every “successful” procedure intentionally kills a human being.

Poverty, lack of health care, and smoking often lead to poor health and sometimes to death, but none of them involves someone intentionally killing another person—and neither does climate change.

And while racial bigotry does involve unjust intent, it rarely leads to intentional killing. Another serious ethical failure in this statement is confusing negative rights (against harm) with positive rights (to benefits). As I demonstrate in my booklet Social Justice vs. Biblical Justice: How Good Intentions Undermine Justice and Gospel, negative rights are consistent and enforceable, but positive rights are inherently self-contradictory and unenforceable. Negative rights are the implication of true, Biblical justice; positive rights are the expression of Marxist/socialist egalitarianism."

And what are the prospects for nuclear energy in a Biden-Harris Administration?

It is now seventy-five years since the U.S. ended the war against Japan by dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (both currently thriving). Eight years later, President Eisenhower, in his world-famous “Atoms for Peace” speech before the United Nations, invited citizens to the debate over using nuclear science and technology for power generation.

President Kennedy switched the nation’s attention from nuclear to the space program, but beginning in the Nixon Administration through the Three Mile Island incident in 1979, the U.S. authorized most of the 99 nuclear reactors at 61 plants still operating in 2017.* As President Trump came to office, the Aspen Institute issued a report asserting, “Nuclear power in the U.S. is at a moment of existential crisis. If the present challenges are not addressed, then the future of nuclear energy may be far less promising and superior U.S. nuclear expertise diminished.”

[*Note. – President Obama’s Clean Energy Plan provided funding for nuclear energy, including creating the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN). And in 2012, despite objections by the chairman, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) authorized Southern Co. to build and operate two new reactors at its Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, the first in the U.S. since 1979.]

The Aspen report asserted boldly that the U.S. needs a strong domestic nuclear program to maintain its exceptional competence to address safety, threat reduction, and nonproliferation issues. They courted the environmental community by noting further that nuclear is a necessary component in the war against climate change if we are to also maintain an adequate supply of affordable electricity. “A world without nuclear power,” the Aspen authors concluded, “would require an incredible – and likely unrealistic – amount of renewables to meet climate targets.”

The Aspen authors further stated that the U.S. public is generally supportive of nuclear power but concerned about nuclear waste. Worse, far too many nuclear power plants in development have broken budgets and fallen behind schedule. Given the lack of political will or a national energy crisis at the time, the authors placed their hope that advanced reactors that use new types of coolants, operate and different pressures and temperatures, or are smaller and more modular, would win widespread approval.

Nuclear waste is now seen as an overhyped, unscientific issue. In a 2019 paper, Aspen Institute trustee Bill Budinger argued that the fear of nuclear waste is largely unfounded – an issue “hugely exaggerated when we were trying to scare people away from nuclear.” The total amount of nuclear waste accumulated over the past 60 years from all U.S. nuclear power plants would fit inside a two-story building covering one city block. And cost overruns and delays are largely the product of anti-nuclear attitudes that have driven regulation to extremes (and are inappropriate for newer reactor designs).

In April 2020 President Trump unveiled his Strategy to Restore American Nuclear Energy Leadership, an initiative to restore America’s long-lost competitive nuclear advantage. The first step outlined in the plan is to revive and strengthen the U.S. uranium mining industry, support uranium conversion services, end reliance on foreign uranium enrichment, and sustain the current fleet of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines.

Among the Trump plan’s many objectives was creating a Uranium Reserve, streamlining regulatory reform and land access for uranium extraction (cutting red tape), supporting the National Reactor Innovation Center and Versatile Test Reactor, demonstrating the use of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors to power federal facilities, and adding protections to prevent future uranium dumping into the U.S. market. [The complete list can be found here.]

In November, the Associated Press reported that the Idaho National Laboratory was the Energy Department’s first choice for constructing and operating the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR). This first new test reactor built in the U.S. in decades would give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette explained that the VTR “continues to be a high-priority project for DOE to ensure nuclear energy plays a role in our country’s energy portfolio.”

Meanwhile, Llewellyn King reported in Forbes in October that there is an active community of entrepreneurs promoting reactors of various designs (including molten salt modular reactors), using in part seed money for SMRs provided through the Obama-era GAIN program. The increase in private investment in nuclear technology and development is a strong sign that nuclear may have finally overcome the media-induced stigma resulting from Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima.*

[*Note. – As Indian researcher Vijay Raj Jayaraj reported recently, the Chernobyl accident happened partly because of intentional negligence of a faulty reactor. Environmentalist Michael Shellenberger pointed out recently that, “Radiation from Chernobyl will kill, at most, 200 people, while the radiation from Fukushima and Three Mile will kill zero people.” Moreover, despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of women aborted their babies after the Chernobyl incident, UCLA researchers found that the children that have been born close to Chernobyl had no detectable abnormalities during their birth.”]

And just this past week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approved a bipartisan bill, the American Nuclear Infrastructure Act (ANIA), that advances President Trump’s initiative to establish a U.S. national strategic uranium reserve. The bill got strong backing from industry officials, including Uranium Energy Corp CEO Amir Adnani.

Adnani said in a statement that, “The bipartisan [American] Nuclear Infrastructure Act is broad-reaching legislation, important for supporting the U.S. nuclear fuel industry, national security, and clean energy. The legislation will provide a clear path for the implementation of the U.S. uranium reserve and provide a strong platform to revitalize the U.S. uranium industry.”

Under ANIA, the Department of Energy may only buy uranium recovered from facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or equivalent agreement state agencies; uranium from companies owned, controlled, or subject to the jurisdiction of Russia or China would be excluded.

According to several prognosticators, the presumed Biden Administration will carry on, or even accelerate, the work initiated by President Obama and championed by President Trump to revitalize and prioritize the U.S. nuclear energy program. Progressive analyst James Conca wrote during the Democratic Party convention that the primary difference between Trump’s and Biden’s nuclear policy is that Biden’s is part of a climate change agenda, while Trump’s focus was on the national security elements of nuclear energy.

According to Conca, “(A)ll the leading climate scientists say we cannot address climate change without significant nuclear power, so supporting nuclear power – or not – is a clear signal about how serious a candidate is about climate change and how serious they are about supporting science over mere activism.” He further insisted that, “if Democrats want any clean energy plan to succeed at all, it better include nuclear.”

Similarly, Josh Siegel, writing in the Washington Examiner, agreed that ”Biden’s support for nuclear power … promises to be one of the rare instances of energy policy continuity between the incoming and outgoing administrations.” Siegel also acknowledged that Democrats, realizing that wind and solar alone are insufficient to decarbonize the power grid, are for the most part giving up their longstanding opposition to nuclear energy.

There is just one caveat. Should for any reason Kamala Harris replace Biden as Commander-in-Chief, her responses during the 2020 Presidential campaign to questions about whether she supported nuclear energy were not so sanguine. On multiple occasions her answer was, “Yes, temporarily, while we increase investment into cleaner renewable alternatives.”

Not exactly a ringing endorsement or acknowledgment of the growing bipartisan energy reality."
